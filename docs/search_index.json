Introduction Performing Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) with g:Profiler. The practical lab contains 2 exercises. The first exercise uses g:Profiler to perform gene-set enrichment analysis. Goal of the exercise 1 Learn how to run g:GOSt Functional profiling from the g:Profiler website and explore the results. Data g:Profiler requires a list of genes, one per line, in a text file or spreadsheet, ready to copy and paste into a web page: for this, we use genes with frequent somatic SNVs identified in TCGA exome sequencing data of 3,200 tumors of 12 types. The MuSiC cancer driver mutation detection software was used to find 127 cancer driver genes that displayed higher than expected mutation frequencies in cancer samples (Supplementary Table 1, which is derived from column B of Supplementary Table 4 in Kandoth C. et al.. Genes are ranked in decreasing order of significance (FDR Q value) and mutation frequency (not shown). Exercise 1 - run g:Profiler For this exercise, our goal is to copy and paste the list of genes into g:Profiler, adjust some parameters (e.g selecting the pathway databases), run the query and explore the results. g:Profiler performs a gene-set enrichment analysis using a hypergeometric test (Fisher’s exact test) with the option to consider the ranking of the genes in the calculation of the enrichment significance (minimum hypergeometric test). The Gene Ontology Biological Process and Reactome are going to be used as pathway databases. The results are displayed as a table or downloadable as an Generic Enrichment Map (GEM) output file. Before starting this exercise, download the required files: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. Supplementary_Tabe1_Cancer_drivers.txt We recommend saving all these files in a personal project data folder before starting. We also recommend creating an additional result data folder to save the files generated while performing the protocol. Step 1 - Launch g:Profiler. Open the g:Profiler website at g:Profiler in your web browser. Step 2 - input query Paste the gene list (Supplementary_Table1_Cancer_drivers.txt) into the Query field in top-left corner of the screen. The gene list can be space-separated or one per line. The organism for the analysis, Homo sapiens, is selected by default. The input list can contain a mix of gene and protein IDs, symbols and accession numbers. Duplicated and unrecognized IDs will be removed automatically, and ambiguous symbols can be refined in an interactive dialogue after submitting the query. open the file in a simple text editor such as Notepad or Textedit to copy the list of genes. Or right click on the file name above and select Open link in new tab Step 3 - Adjust parameters. 3a. Click on the Advanced options tab (black rectangle) to expand it. Set Significance threshold to “Benjamini-Hochberg FDR” User threshold - select 0.05 if you want g:Profiler to return only pathways that are significant (FDR &lt; 0.05). if g:Profiler does not return any results increase the threshold (0.1, then 1) to check that g:Profiler is running successfully but there are simply no significant results for your query. 3b. Click on the Data sources tab (black rectangle) to expand it. UnSelect all gene-set databases by clicking the “clear all” button. In the Gene Ontology category, check GO Biological Process and No electronic GO annotations. No electronic GO annotations option will discard less reliable GO annotations (inferred from electronic annotations (IEAs)) that are not manually reviewed. if g:Profiler does not return any results uncheck the No electronic GO annotation option to expand annotations used in the test. In the biological pathways category, check Reactome. Step 4 - Run query Click on the Run query button to run g:Profiler. Scroll down page to see results. If after clicking on Run query button the analysis completes but there is the following message above results file - Select the Ensembl ID with the most GO annotations (all). For each ambiguous gene select its correct mapping. Ambiguous mapping is often caused by multiple ensembl ids for a given gene and are easy to resolve as a user. Rerun query. Step 5 - Explore the results. Step 5a: After the query has run, the results are displayed at the bottom of the page, below the input parameters. By default, the “Results” tab is selected. A global graph displays gene-sets that passed the significance threshold of 0.05 for the 2 gene-set databases that we have selected, GO Biological Process(GO:BP) and Reactome(REAC). Numbers in parentheses are indicating the number of gene-sets that passed the threshold. Step5b: Click on “Detailed Results” to view the results in more depth. Two tables are displayed, one for each of the data sources selected. (If more than 2 data sources are selected there will be additional tables for each datasource) Each row of the table contains: Term name - gene-set name Term ID - gene-est identifier Padj - FDR value -log10(Padj) - enrichment score calculated using the formula -log10(padj) variable number of gene columns (One for each gene in the query set) - If the gene is present in the current gene-set its cell is colored. For any data source besides GO the cell is colored black if the gene is found in the gene-set. For the GO data source cells are colored according to the annotation evidence code. Expand the legend tab for detailed coloring mapping of GO evidence codes. The first table displays the gene-sets significantly enriched at FDR 0.05 for the GO:BP database. The second table displays the results corresponding to the Reactome database. Step 6: Expand the stats tab Expand the stats tab by clicking on the double arrow located at the right of the tab. It displays the gene set size (T), the size of our gene list (Q) , the number of genes that overlap between our gene list and the tested gene-set (TnQ) as well as the number of genes in the background (U). Above the GO:BP result table, locate the slide bar that enables to select for the minimum and maximum number of genes in the tested gene-sets (Term size). Change the maximum Term size from 10000 to 250 and observe the results in the detailed stats panel: Without filtering term size, the top terms were GO terms containing that could contain 4000 or 5000 genes and that were located high in the GO hierarchy (parent term). With filtering the maximum term size to 250, the top list contains pathways of larger interpretative values. However, please note that the adjusted pvalues was calculated using all gene-sets without size filtering. Step 7: Save the results 7a. In the Detailed Results panel, select “GEM” . It will save the results in a text file in the “Generic Enrichment Map” format that we will use to visualize using Cytoscape. select max term size to 10000 ( = no filtering by gene-set size) and click on the GEM button. A file is downloaded on your computer. (change the name to gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm10000.gem.txt) select max term size to 1000 ( = filter by gene-set size) and click on the GEM button. A file is downloaded on your computer. (change the name to gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm1000.gem.txt) select max term size to 250 ( = filter by gene-set size) and click on the GEM button. A file is downloaded on your computer. (change the name to gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm250.gem.txt) 7b: Open the file that you saved using the geneset threshold of 250 using Microsoft Office Excel or in an equivalent software. Observe the results included in this file: Name of each gene-set Description of each gene-set significance of the overlap (pvalue) significance of the overlap (adjusted pvalue/qvalue) Phenotype Genes included in each gene-set Which term has the best corrected p-value? Which genes in our list are included in this term? Observe that same genes can be present in several lines (pathways are related when they contain a lof of genes in common). The table is formatted for the input into Cytoscape EnrichmentMap. It is called the generic format. The p-value and FDR columns contain identical values because g:Profiler directly outputs the FDR (= corrected p-value) meaning that the p-value column is already the FDR. Phenotype 1 means that each pathway will be represented by red nodes on the enrichment map (presented during next module). The term regulation of cell cycle G1/S phase transition is the most significant gene-set (=the lowest FDR value). Many gene-sets from the top of this list are related to each other and have genes in common. Step 8 (Optional but recommended) 8a. Download the pathway database files. Go to the top of the page and expand the “Data sources” tab. Click on the ‘combined name.gmt’ link located at bottom of this tab. It will download a file named combined name.gmt containing a pathway database gmt file with all the available sources. 8b. concatenate the GO:BP and Reactome gmt files: If you want to create a smaller gmt file that doesn’t contain all of the gprofiler datasources you can instead download name.gmt.zip that contains each datasource as its own gmt file. You will need to concatenate the sources you require into one gmt file to use for later. Option 1: manually if you are not familiar with unix commands open a text editor such a Notepad or equivalent open hsapiens.GO:BP.name.gmt using the text editor open gmt hsapiens.REAC.name.gmt using the text editor copy-paste all the rows from REAC file together with all the rows in GO:BP file and save it as hsapiens.pathways.name.gmt . Option 2: using the cat command if you are familiar with unix commands open your terminal window cd to the unzipped gprofiler_hsapiens.name folder type the following command: cat hsapiens.GO:BP.name.gmt hsapiens.REAC.name.gmt &gt; hsapiens.pathways.name.gmt you will be using this optional hsapiens.pathways.name.gmt file in Cytoscape EnrichmentMap. Exercise 2: Load and use a custom .gmt file and run the query For this exercise, our goal is to copy and paste the list of genes into g:Profiler, upload a custom gmt file, adjust some parameters (e.g selecting the pathway databases), run the query and explore the results. Uploading a custom gmt file enables us to use alternate pathway data sources not available in g:Profiler. We are going to use a gmt file that contains a database of pathway gene sets used for pathway enrichment analysis in the standard GMT format downloaded from http://baderlab.org/GeneSets and updated monthly. This file contains pathways from eight data sources: GO, Reactome, Panther, NetPath, NCI, MSigDB curated gene sets (C2 collection, excluding Reactome and KEGG), MSigDB Hallmark (H collection) and HumanCyc. A GMT file is a text file in which each line represents a gene set for a single pathway. Each line includes a pathway ID, a name and the list of associated genes in a tab-separated format. This file has been filtered to exlclude gene-sets that contained more than 250 genes as these gene-sets are associated with more general terms. Before starting this exercise, download the required files: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. Supplementary_Tabe1_Cancer_drivers.txt Baderlab_genesets.gmt (from September 2020). We recommend saving all these files in a personal project data folder before starting. We also recommend creating an additional result data folder to save the files generated while performing the protocol. STEPS: Repeat step 1 to 3a from Exercise 1 (go back to exercise 1 to get detailed instructions) Briefly: Step 1: Open g:profiler Step 2a : Copy and paste the gene list in the Query field Step 2b: Click on the Advanced options tab (black rectangle) to expand it. Set Significance threshold to “Benjamini-Hochberg FDR”. Step 3a: Click on the Data sources tab (black rectangle) to expand it. Unselect all choices by clicking the “clear all” button. Step 4: Click on the Custom GMT tab (black rectangle) to expand it. Drag in the box the Baderlab gmt file Baderlab_genesets.gmt. Once uploaded successfully, the name of the file is displayed in the “File name used” box. Step 5: Click on Run query . Step 6: Explore the detailed results Step 7: Save the file as GEM Optional steps Please follow these optional steps if time permits and/or to explore more g:Profiler parameters. Here below are 3 optional steps that cover several options offered by g:Profiler: test different data sources, take the order of the gene list into account, use different types of multiple hypothesis correction methods. Use the same gene list as used in exercise 1 and modify paramters listed above. Observe the results. Optional 1: If time permits, play with input parameters, e.g. add TRANSFAC and miRTarBase databases, rerun the query and explore the new results. Transfac putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) from TRANSFAC database are retrieved into g:GOSt through a special prediction pipeline. First, TFBSs are found by matching TRANSFAC position specific matrices using the program Match on range +/-1kb from TSS as provided by APPRIS (Annotating principal splice isoforms) via Ensembl biomart. For genes with multiple primary TSS annotations we selected one with most TF matches. The matching range for C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae is 1kb upstream from ATG (translation start site). A cut-off value to minimize the number of false positive matches (provided by TRANSFAC) is then applied to remove spurious motifs. Remaining matches are split into two inclusive groups based on the amount of matches, i.e TFBSs that have at least 1 match are classified as match class 0 and TFBSs that have at least 2 matches per gene are classified as match class 1. mirTarBase is a database that holds experimentally validated information about genes that are targetted by miRNAs. We include all the organisms that are covered by mirTarBase. Option 2: Re-run the g:Profiler using the ordered query checked. This will run the minimum hypergeometric test. g:Profiler then performs incremental enrichment analysis with increasingly larger numbers of genes starting from the top of the list. When this option is checked, it assumes that the genes were preordered by significance with the most significant gene at the top of the list. Compare the results between “ordered” and non ordered query. for this practical lab, the genes were ordered by the number of mutations found in these genes for all samples. For example, TP53, a highly mutated genes is listed at the top. Option 3 : Re-run g:Profiler and select g:SCS or Bonferonni as method to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. Do you get any significant results? you can get detailed information about these methods at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/docs in the section Significance threshold. Instead of using the g:Profiler website g:profiler can be run directly from R or python see g:Profiler document for more info at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/r "],["gsea-lab.html", "Module 2 lab - GSEA Introduction Goal of the exercise Data Background Additional information", " Module 2 lab - GSEA Presenter: Ruth Isserlin Introduction This practical lab contains one exercise. It uses GSEA to perform a gene-set enrichment analysis. Goal of the exercise Learn how to run GSEA and explore the results. Data The data used in this exercise is gene expression (transcriptomics) obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing of Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma samples. This cohort was previously stratified into four distinct expression subtypes PMID:21720365 and a subset of the immunoreactive and mesenchymal subtypes are compared to demonstrate the GSEA workflow. How was the data processed? Gene expression from the TCGA Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma RNASeq V2 cohort was downloaded on 2015-05-22 from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Differential expression for all genes between the mesenchymal and immunoreactive groups was estimated using edgeR.The R code used to generate the data and the rank file used in GSEA is included at the bottom of the document in the Additional information section. Background The goal of this lab is to: Upload the 2 required files into GSEA, Adjust relevant parameters, Run GSEA, Open and explore the gene-set enrichment results. The 2 required files are: a rank file (.rnk) a pathway definition file (.gmt). Rank File To generate a rank file (.rnk), a score (-log10(pvalue) * sign(logFC)) was calculated from the edgeR differential expression results. A gene that is significantly differentially expressed(i.e associated with a very small pvalue, close to 0) will be assigned a high score.The sign of the logFC indicates if the gene has an expression which is higher in mesenchymal (logFC &gt; 0, the score will have a + sign) or lower in mesenchymal (logFC &lt; 0, the score will have a - sign). It is used to rank the genes from top up-regulated to top down-regulated (all genes have to be included). The rank file is going to be provided for the lab, you don’t need to generate it. How to generate a rank file. Calculation of the score Generation of the rank file select the gene names and score columns and save the file as tab delimited with the extension .rnk Pathway defintion file The second file that is needed for GSEA is the pathway database, a file with the .gmt extension. The pathway database (.gmt) used for the GSEA analysis was downloaded from http://baderlab.org/GeneSets. This file contains gene-sets obtained from MsigDB-c2, NCI, Biocarta, IOB, Netpath, HumanCyc, Reactome and the Gene Ontology (GO) databases. You don’t need to perform this step for the exercise, the .gmt file will be given to you. Please note that gmt files from October 2020 - May 2021 currently have an issue created during the build and need to be fixed Go to: http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/ click on September_01_2020/ Click on Human/ Click on symbol/ save the Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea…gmt file on your computer The .gmt is a tab delimited text file which contains one gene-set per row. For each gene-set (row), the first 2 columns contain the name and the description of the gene-set and the remaining columns contain the list of genes included in the gene-set. It is possible to create a custom gene-set using Excel or R. GSEA performs a gene-set enrichment analysis using a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. The output result consists of summary tables displaying enrichment statistics for each gene-set (pathway) that has been tested. Start the exercise Before starting this exercise, download the 2 required files: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol.gmt MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_edger_ranks.rnk Step1.

In this protocol, the maximum is set to 200 to decrease some of the larger sets in the results. 3j. Min size: exclude smaller sets – By default GSEA sets the lower limit to 15. In this protocol, the minimum is set to 10 to increase some of the smaller sets in the results. 3k. Save results in this folder – navigate to where you want GSEA to put the results folder. By default GSEA will put the results into the directory gsea_home/output/[date] in your home directory. set Enrichment Statistics to p2 if you want to add more weight on the most top up-regulated and top down-regulated. P2 is a more stringent parameter and it will result in less gene-sets significant under FDR &lt;0.05. Step 4. Run GSEA 4a. Click on Run button located at the bottom right corner of the window. Expand the window size if the run button is not visible 4b. On the panel located on the left side of the GSEA window, the bottom panel called the GSEA report table will show that it has created a process with a message that it is Running. On completion the status message will be updated to Success…. There is no progress bar to indicate to the user how much time is left to complete the process. Depending on the size of your dataset and compute power a GSEA run can take from a few minutes to a few hours. To check on the status of the GSEA run in the bottom left hand corner you can click on the + (red circle in below Figure) to see the updating status. Printouts in the format shuffleGeneSet for GeneSet 5816/6878 nperm: 100 indicate how many permutations have been done (5816) out of the total that need to be performed (6878). if the permutations have been completed but the status is still running, it means that GSEA is creating the report Java Heap Space error. If GSEA returns an error Java Heap space it means that GSEA has run out of memory. If you are running GSEA from the webstart other than the 4GB option then you will need to download a new version that allows for more memory allocation. The current maximum memory allocation that the GSEA webstart allows for is 4GB. If you are using this version and still receive the java heap error you will need to download the GSEA java jar file and launch it from the command line as described in step 1. Step 5. Examining the results 5a. Click on Success to launch the results in html format in your default web browser. If the GSEA application has been closed, you can still see the results by opening the result folder and clicking on the index file – index.html. (see screenshot below). The first phenotype corresponds to gene-sets enriched in genes up-regulated in the mesenchymal subtype. The second phenotype corresponds to gene-sets enriched in genes up-regulated in the immunological phenotype. When examining the results there are a few things to look for: 5b. Check the number of gene-sets that have been used for the analysis. A small number (a few hundred genesets if using baderlab genesets) could indicate an issue with identifier mapping. 5c. Check the number of sets that have FDR less than 0.25 – in order to determine what thresholds to start with when creating the enrichment map. It is not uncommon to see a thousand gene sets pass the threshold of FDR less than 0.25. FDR less than 0.25 is a very lax threshold and for robust data we can set thresholds of FDR less than 0.05 or lower. 5d. Click on Snapshots to see the trend for the top 20 genesets. For the positive phenotype the top genesets should show a distribution skewed to the left (positive) i.e. genesets have predominance of up-regulated genes. For the negative phenotype the top geneset should be inverted and skewed to the right (negative) i.e. geneset have predominance of down-regulated genes. 5e. Explore the tabular format of the results.

By Veronique Voisin, Ruth Isserlin, Gary Bader Goal of the exercise Create an enrichment map and navigate through the network During this exercise, you will learn how to create an enrichment map from gene-set enrichment results. The enrichment results chosen for this exercise are generated using g:Profiler but an enrichment map can be created directly from output from GSEA, g:Profiler, GREAT, BinGo, Enrichr or alternately from any gene-set tool using the generic enrichment results format. Data The data used in this exercise is a list of frequently mutated genes that we used in previous exercise. Pathway enrichment analysis has been run using g:Profiler and the results have been downloaded as a GEM format. EnrichmentMap A circle (node) is a gene-set (pathway) enriched in genes that we used as input in g:Profiler (frequently mutated genes). edges (lines) represent genes in common between 2 pathways (nodes). A cluster of nodes represent overlapping and related pathways and may represent a common biological process. Clicking on a node will display the genes included in each pathway. Description of this exercise We run and saved g:Profiler results using different parameters. An enrichment map represents the result of enrichment analysis as a network where significantly enriched gene-sets that share a lot of genes in common will form identifiable clusters. The visualization of the results as these biological themes will ease the interpretation of the results. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to: upload g:Profiler results into Cytoscape EnrichmentMap to create a map. upload several g:Profiler results at the same time to create one map and learn how to distinguish the results. to compare the differences resulting from the use of different g:Profiler parameters at the enrichment map level. Start the exercise To start the lab practical section, first create a gprofiler_files directoty on your computer and download the files below. Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. Five files are needed for this exercise: Enrichment result 1: gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm10000.gem.txt In g:Profiler, the parameters that we used to generate this file were: GO_BP no electronic annotation, Reactome, Benjamini-HochBerg FDR 0.05 No restriction on the number of genes in a geneset Enrichment result 2:gProfiler_hsapiens_lab2_results_GEM_maxterm250.gem.txt In g:Profiler, the parameters that we used were: GO_BP no electronic annotation, Reactome, Benjamini-HochBerg FDR 0.05. The results were filtered using the g:Profiler Term size slidebar and only the enriched gene-sets that contain equal or less than 250 genes per gene-set were included in the result file (gProfiler_hsapiens_max250.gem.txt). Enrichment result 3:gProfiler_hsapiens_Baderlab_max250_gem.txt Pathway database 1 (.gmt):gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt This file can be downloaded directly or can be been created by concatenating the hsapiens.GO/BP.name.gm and the hsapiens.REAC.name.gmt files contained in the g:Profiler gprofiler_hsapiens.name folder. Pathway database 2 (.gmt):Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol_max250gssize.gmt Exercise 1a - compare different gprofiler geneset size results Step 1 Launch Cytoscape and open the EnrichmentMap App 1a. Double click on Cytoscape icon 1b. Open EnrichmentMap App In the Cytoscape top menu bar: Click on Apps -&gt; EnrichmentMap A ‘Create Enrichment Map’ window is now opened. Step 2 Create an enrichment map from 2 datasets and with a gmt file. 2a. In the ‘Create Enrichment Map’ window, drag and drop the 2 enrichment files gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000.gem.txt and gProfiler_hsapiens_max250.gem.txt. 2b. In the white box, click on \"gProfiler_hsapiens_max250.gem (Generic/gProfiler) 2c. On the right side, go to the GMT field, click on the 3 radio button (…) and locate the file gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt that you have saved on your computer to upload it. 2d. In the white box, click on \"gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000 (Generic/gProfiler) 2e. On the right side, go to the GMT field, click on the 3 radio button (…) and locate the file gprofiler_full_hsapiens.name.gmt that you have saved on your computer to upload it. 2f. Locate the FDR q-value cutoff field and set the value to 0.001 2g. Select the Connectivity slide bar to sparse. 2h. Click on Build. a status bar should pop up showing progress of the Enrichment map build. Step3: Explore the results: In the EnrichmentMap control panel located at the left: select the 2 Data Sets (checked by default) set Chart Data o Color by Data Set select Publication Ready to remove gene-set label to have a global view of the map. un-select Publication Ready when you explore the map in more detail to see the gene-set names. On the map, a node that is coloured both green and blue is a gene-set that is found in the both of the 2 gProfiler result sets that we have been uploaded. A node that is blue is a gene-set that is found only in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000 . A node that is green is a gene-set that is found only in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max250 . A blue edge represents genes that overlap between gene-sets found in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000. A green edge represents genes that overlap between gene-sets found in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max250.gem. We can see clusters of blue nodes. All these nodes contain gene-sets that have more than 250 genes. Explore the detailed view (see below) to see if this cluster corresponds to informative terms. Would you have lost information by filtering gene-sets larger than 250 genes? Explore Detailed results In the Cytoscape menu bar, select ‘View\" and ’Show Graphic Details’ to display node labels. Make sure you have unselected “Publication Ready” in the EnrichmentMap control panel. Zoom in to be able to read the labels and navigate the network using the bird eye view (blue rectangle). Select a node and visualize the Table Panel Click on a node For this example the node “Signaling by Notch” has been selected. you can type it in the search bar, quotes are important. When the node is selected, it is highlighted in yellow. In table panel, we can see the genes included in the gene-set. A green colored box indicates that the gene is in the gene-set(pathway) and in our gene list. A gray colored box indicated that the gene is in the gene-set but not in our gene list. Exercise 1b - Is specifying the gmt file important? Create an enrichment map without a gmt file to compare the results with Exercise 1a. Go to Control Panel and select the EnrichmentMap tab. Click on the “+” sign to re-open the Create Enrichment Map window. In the white box, select the \"gProfiler_hsapiens_max250.gem (Generic/gProfiler) file Locate the GMT field and delete the file name , leaving it blank. In the white box, select the \"gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000 (Generic/gProfiler) file Locate the GMT field and delete the file name , leaving it blank. Use same parameters as in exercise 1a: FDR q-value cutoff of 0.001 and Connectivity to sparse. Click on Build Explore the results: In the EnrichmentMap control panel located at the left: select the 2 Data Sets (selecteded by default) set Chart Data o Color by Data Set select Publication Ready to remove gene-set label to have a global view of the map. uncheck this box when you explore the map in details to see the gene-set names. On the map, a node that is coloured both green and blue is a gene-set that is found in the both of the 2 gProfiler result sets that we have been uploaded. A node that is blue is a gene-set that is found only in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000 . A node that is green is a gene-set that is found only in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max250 . A blue edge represents genes that overlap between gene-sets found in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max10000. A green edge represents genes that overlap between gene-sets found in the file gProfiler_hsapiens_max250.gem. Conclusion of exercises 1 a and 1b: Loading a gmt file to create an enrichment map from g:Profiler result is optional. However, there are 2 main beneficial aspects to uploading a gmt file: the map will be less condensed and easier to read and interpret. clicking on a node will display all genes in the gene-set and not only genes included in our query list. Exercise 1c - create EM from results using Baderlab genesets Create an enrichment map from the results of g:Profiler generated using the custom Baderlab gene-set file. To get a map that is easy to read and that does not display too many gene-sets, one option is to focus the analysis on gene-sets (pathways) that contain 250 genes or less. We prefiltered our pathway database prior to upload it into g:Profiler so that FDR is calculated only on these gene-sets ( as opposed to exercise 1a where the FDR was calculated on all gene-sets and then some gene-sets &gt; 250 genes were excluded from the result file ). filtered gmt file: (Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol_maxgssize250.gmt. We have uploaded this file as a custom gmt file in g:Profiler and run the query. (in Module 2 lab) To create an enrichment map of these results: Go to Control Panel and select the EnrichmentMap tab. Click on the “+” sign to re-open the Create Enrichment Map window. Drag the file that we created in Module 2 lab gProfiler_hsapiens_Baderlab_max250_gem.txt and the filtered gmt file (Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol_maxgssize250.gmt into the Datasets box on Enrichment map panel. In the white box, select the \"gProfiler_hsapiens_Baderlab_max250_gem.txt (Generic/gProfiler) file Locate the GMT field and upload the file “Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol_max250gssize.gmt”. Explore the results: SAVE YOUR CYTOSCAPE SESSION (.cys) FILE ! Exercise 1c (optional) - investigate individual pathways in GeneMANIA or String Each node in the Enrichment map represents a biological process or pathway. It consists of a collection of genes. Often we want to know how the genes in that group interact. There are many different ways you can investigate the underlying interactions for the given group. Some involve searching online databases and others are directly integrated into cytoscape. GeneMANIA - an integrative database of gene connections including co-expression, protein interactions, genetic interactions, pathways and more. Cytoscape App String - - an integrative database of gene connections including co-expression, protein interactions, genetic interactions, pathways and more. Cytoscape App Pathway Commons - a intergrative database of pathways. (There is a beta feature in EM to show your pathway in the painter app, a pathway common web page that overlays your expression data on the given pathway.

By Veronique Voisin, Ruth Isserlin, Gary Bader Goal of the exercise: Exercise 1 - Create an enrichment map and navigate through the network During this exercise, you will learn how to create an EnrichmentMap from gene-set enrichment results. The enrichment tool chosen for this exercise is GSEA but an enrichment map can be created from output from GSEA, g:Profiler, GREAT, BinGo, Enrichr or alternately from any gene-set tool using the generic enrichment results format. Exercise 2 - Post analysis (add drug target gene-sets to the network) As second part of the exercise, you will learn how to expand the network by adding an extra layer of information. Exercise 3 - Autoannotate A last optional exercise guides you toward the creation of automatically generated cluster labels to the network. Data The data used in this exercise is gene expression data obtained from high throughput RNA sequencing. They correspond to Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma samples. We use precomputed results of the GSEA analysis Module 2 lab - gsea to create an enrichment map with the aim to transform the tabular format in a network to better visualize the relationships between the significant gene-sets: The output results of GSEA are 2 tables: One table (pos) contains all pathways with an enrichment score (significant or not) related to enrichment of the mesenchymal category (positive score). One table (neg) contains all pathways with an enrichment score (significant or not) related to enrichment of the immunoreactive category (negative score). These 2 tables are uploaded using the EnrichmentMap App which will create a network of mesenchymal and immunoreactive pathways that have a significant score (FDR &lt;= 0.0001) for clearer visualization of the results. EnrichmentMap A red circle (node) is a pathway specific of the mesenchymal type. A blue circle (node) is a pathway specific of the immunoreactive type. An edge represents genes in common between 2 pathways (nodes). A cluster of nodes represent overlapping and related pathways and may represent a common biological process. Clicking on a node will display the genes included in each pathway. Exercise 1 - GSEA output and EnrichmentMap To start the lab practical section, first download the files. Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. 7 Files are needed to create the enrichment map for this exercise (please download these files on your computer or alternately use the GSEA directory created in module 2 lab - gsea for files 1,2,3) : GMT (file containing all pathways and corresponding genes) - Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol.gmt Enrichments 1 (GSEA results for the “pos” mesenchymal phenotype) - gsea_report_for_na_pos_1620239732698.tsv Enrichments 2 (GSEA results for the “neg” immunoreactive phenotype) - gsea_report_for_na_neg_1620239732698.tsv Expression (file containing the RNAseq data for all samples and all genes) - MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_rnaseq_expression.txt Rank file (file that has been used as input to GSEA) - MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_edger_ranks.rnk Classes (define which samples are mesenchymal and which samples are immunoreactive) - MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_rnaseq_classes.cls Drug target database (preselection of 4 drugs and their target genes in the post analysis exercise, http://www.drugbank.ca/) - Human_DrugBank_approved_symbol_selected.gmt Follow the steps described below at your own pace: Step 1 Launch Cytoscape and open EnrichmentMap App 1a. Double click on the Cytoscape icon 1b. Open EnrichmentMap App In the top menu bar: Click on Apps -&gt; EnrichmentMap A ’Create EnrichmentMap window is now opened. Step 2 Create an enrichment map 2a. In the ‘Create EnrichmentMap’ window, add a dataset of the GSEA type by clicking on the ‘+’ plus sign. 2b. Specify the following parameters and upload the specified files: Name: leave default or a name of your choice like “GSEAmap” Analysis Type: GSEA Enrichments Pos: gsea_report_for_na_pos_1620239732698.tsv Enrichments Ned: gsea_report_for_na_neg_1620239732698.tsv GMT : Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_September_01_2020_symbol.gmt Ranks: MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_edger_ranks.rnk Expressions : MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_rnaseq_expression.txt. this field is optional but recommended Classes: MesenchymalvsImmunoreactive_rnaseq_classes.cls this field is optional. Phenotypes: In the text boxes place Mesenchymal as the Positive phenotype Immunoreactive as the Negative phenotype. Mesenchymal will be associated with red nodes because it corresponds to the positive phenotype and Immunoreactive will be associated with the blue nodes because it corresponds to the negative phenotype. set FDR q-value cutoff to 0.0001 (= only gene-sets significantly enriched at a value of 0.0001 or less will be displayed on the map). it will be displayed as 1E-04 in the scientific notation. 2c. Click on Build We populated the fields manually. If you work with your own data, a way to populate automatically the fields is to drag and drop your GSEA folder in the ‘Data Set’ window. You are encouraged to give it a try once you finished the lab with your own GSEA results. Unformatted results: layout will be different for each user (there is a random seed in the layout algorithm) but it does not change the results or interpretation (the connections are the same, only the display is different). Step 3 Navigate the enrichment map to gain a better understanding of a EnrichmentMap network. General layout of Cytoscape panel: In addition to the main window where the network is displayed, there are 2 panels: the Control Panel on the left side and the Table Panel at the bottom of the window. Steps: 3a. In the Cytocape menu bar, select View and Show Graphic details. It will turn the squared nodes into circles and the gene-set labels will be visible. 3b: Zoom in or out using + or - in toolbar or scroll button on mouse until you are able to read the labels comfortably. 3c: Use the bird’s eye view (located at the bottom of the control panel) to navigate around the network by moving the blue rectangle using the mouse or trackpad. 3d: Click on an individual node of interest. For this example, you could use Integrin signalling pathway. If you are unable to locate Integrin signalling pathway, type “Integrin signalling pathway” in the search box (quotes are important). Selected nodes appear yellow (or highlighted) in the network. 3e. In the Table Panel in the EM Heat map tab change: Expressions: Row Norm Compress: -None- Genes in the heatmap that are highlighted yellow (rank column) represent genes that are part of the leading edge for this gene set, i.e. contributed the most to the enriched phenotype. Leading edge genes will only be highlighted if an individual node has been selected and the Enrichment Map was created from GSEA results. Troubleshooting: if you don’t see the sort column highlighted in yellow, reselect the node of interest and click on the GSEARanking Data Set 1 text in the EM Heatmap tab. Step 4 Use Filters to automatically select nodes on the map: Move the blue nodes to the left side of the window and the red nodes to the right side of the window. 4a. Locate the Filter tab on the side bar of the Control Panel. 4b. Click on the + sign to view the menu and select Column Filter. 4c. From the Choose column … box, select Node: ES_dataset1 and set filter values from -0.953 and 0 inclusive. 4d. The blue nodes are now automatically selected. Zoom out to be able to look at the entire network and drag all blue nodes to the left side of the screen. 4e. Optional. Change is to is not to select the red nodes. The red pathways (nodes) are specific to the mesenchymal phenotype. They were listed in the pos table of the GSEA results. The enrichment score (ES) values in this table are all positive values. The blue pathways are specific to the immunoreactive phenotype and were listed in the neg table of the GSEA results. The ES values in this table are all negative values. This is the information we used as the filtering criteria. Exercise 2 - Post analysis (add drug target gene-sets to the network) Step 5 Add drug target gene-sets to the network (Add Signature Gene-Sets…). 5a. In Control Panel, go to the EnrichmentMap tab and click on “Add Signature Gene Sets…” located below the white ‘Data Sets:’ box. A window named \"EnrichmentMap: Add Signature Gene Sets (Post-Analysis) is now opened. 5b. Using the ‘Load from File…’ button, select the Human_DrugBank_approved_symbol_selected.gmt file that you saved on your computer. 5c. Click on “Finish”. Four additional nodes are now added to the network and visible as grey diamonds. Dotted orange edges represent their overlap with the nodes of our network. These additional nodes represent gene targets of some approved drugs and these genes are either specific of the mesenchymal type (dotted orange edges connected to red nodes) or specific of the immunoreactive type (dotted orange edges connected to blue nodes). more info using this link: https://enrichmentmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PostAnalysis.html Exercise 3 - Autoannotate the Network Step 6 Auto-annotate the network with cluster labels. The Apps WordCloud, ClusterMaker and Autoannotate have to be installed. (they should have been installed during the pre-workshop set up) if you ran step 5, delete the drug targets diamond nodes and associated edge before performing step 6: select the 4 nodes and associated dotted orange edges by browsing the mouse and click “delete” on your keyboard or in the Cytoscape menu, ‘Edit’, ‘Delete Selected Nodes and Edges’. Alternately, in the Enrichment Map Input Panel in the Datasets box, un-select “Human_Drugbank_approved_symbol_selected” to hide the post analysis nodes. 6a. In the menu bar, select Apps, AutoAnnotate, New Annotation Set …. An Autoannotate: Create Annotation Set window pops up. Leave default settings and click on Create Annotations. In the case that an AutoAnnotate window pops up with the message AutoAnnotate will manage all groups in this network view, click OK. The network is now subdivided into clusters that are represented by ellipses. Each of these clusters are composed of pathways (nodes) interconnected by many common genes. These pathways represent similar biological processes. The app WordCloud take all the labels of the pathways in one cluster and summarize them as a unique cluster label displayed at the top of each ellipse. Tip 1: further editing and formatting can be performed on the AutoAnnote results using the AutoAnnotate Display in the Results Panels located at the right side of the window. For example, it is possible to change Ellipse to Rectangle, uncheck Scale font by cluster size and increase the Font Scale using the scaling bar. It is also possible to reduce the length of the cluster label by checking the “Word Wrap” option. Tip 2: The AutoAnnotate window on the left side in Result Panel contains the list of all clusters. Clicking on a cluster label will highlight in yellow all nodes in this cluster. It is then easy to move the nodes using the mouse to avoid cluster overlaps. 6b. If your network is dense and clusters are overlapping, there is an option in AutoAnnotate that you can try that expands the network to prevent cluster overlap. In the menu bar, select Apps, AutoAnnotate, New Annotation Set …. An Autoannotate: Create Annotation Set window pops up. Check the Layout network to prevent cluster overlap and click on Create Annotations. Exercise 4 (Optional) - Explore results in GeneMANIA or STRING Each node in the Enrichment map represents a biological process or pathway. It consists of a collection of genes. Often we want to know how the genes in that group interact. There are many different ways you can investigate the underlying interactions for the given group. Some involve searching online databases and others are directly integrated into cytoscape. GeneMANIA - an integrative database of gene connections including co-expression, protein interactions, genetic interactions, pathways and more. Cytoscape App String - - an integrative database of gene connections including co-expression, protein interactions, genetic interactions, pathways and more. Cytoscape App Pathway Commons - a intergrative database of pathways. (There is a beta feature in EM to show your pathway in the painter app, a pathway common web page that overlays your expression data on the given pathway. Still in beta testing and requires expression data to work correctly so won’t work for this example) Step 7 Visualize genes in a pathway/node of interest using the apps STRING and GeneMANIA. This will create a protein-protein interaction network using the genes included in the pathway. Note: We will go more in depth into GeneMANIA in module 6 7a: Click on an individual node of interest. For this example, you could use BMP receptor signaling. If you are unable to locate BMP receptor signaling, type “BMP receptor signaling” in the search box (quotes are important). The selected node appears yellow (or highlighted) in the network. If you have annotated your network, it should be included in the BMP stimulus receptor cluster. 7b: Right Click on the node of interest to diplay the option menu. Select Apps,–&gt; EnrichmentMap - Show in STRING A STRING Protein Query box appears. select Select genes with expression. Click on OK. The resulting network will look something like this. Explore the features and data of each Cytoscape app.What happens to the network if you change the initial parameters like Confidence cutoff or Max Additional interactors 7c:Go back to enrichment map network. In Control Panel (left side of the window), select the “Network” tab and click on the Enrichment Map network as shown in below screenshot. 7d: Search again for the node labelled BMP receptor signaling as in Step 7a. Right Click on the node of interest to diplay the option menu. Select Apps,–&gt; EnrichmentMap - Show in STRING A GeneMANIA Query box appears. select Select genes with expression. Click on OK. A pop up will appear indicating that it is currenlty querying GeneMANIA The resulting network will look similiar to the below screenshot. It is possible to view gene expression data for the nodes in the STRING network. See the section https://enrichmentmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Integration.html and try it out after the workshop.

By Ruth Isserlin Although a lot of what we have demonstrated in Cytoscape up until now has been manual most of the features we use can be automated through multiple access points including: R/Rstudio using RCy3 - a bioconductor package that makes communicating with cytoscape as simple as calling a method. Python using py2cytoscape. directly through cyrest using rest calls - you can use any programming language with the rest API. See Cytoscape Automation Automation becomes helpful when performing pipelines multiple times on similiar datasets or integrating cytoscape data into your other pipelines. Below we demonstrate how to perform the enrichment map pipeline from R but automation is not limited to this access point. You can automate it from any flavour of programming. Check out all the ways you can interact with Cytoscape here including directly through the cytoscape command window. Goal of the exercise: Run an enrichment analysis and Create an enrichment map automatically from R/Rstudio During this exercise, you will apply what you have learnt in Module 2 labs and Module 3 labs but instead of performing them manually you will automate the process using R/Rstudio. We will use all the same data and programs we used in the previous labs but we will control them from R. Before starting this exercise you need to set up R/Rstudio. You can do that directly on your machine or through docker. Set Up - Option 1 - Install R/Rstudio Install R. Go to: https://cran.rstudio.com/ If installing on Windows select “install R for the first time” to get to the required package. RStudio is a free IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. RStudio is a wrapper1 for R and as far as basic R is concerned, all the underlying functions are the same, only the user interface is different (and there are a few additional functions that are very useful e.g. for managing projects). Here is a small list of differences between R and RStudio. pros (some pretty significant ones actually): Integrated version control. Support for “projects” that package scripts and other assets. Syntax-aware code colouring. A consistent interface across all supported platforms. (Base R GUIs are not all the same for e.g. Mac OS X and Windows.) Code autocompletion in the script editor. (Depending on your point of view this can be a help or an annoyance. I used to hate it. After using it for a while I find it useful.) “Function signaturtes” (a list of named parameters) displayed when you hover over a function name. The ability to set breakpoints for debugging in the script editor. Support for knitr, and rmarkdown; also support for R notebooks … (This supports “literate programming” and is actually a big advance in software development) Support for R notebooks. cons (all minor actually): The tiled interface uses more desktop space than the windows of the R GUI. There are sometimes (rarely) situations where R functions do not behave in exactly the same way in RStudio. The supported R version is not always immediately the most recent release. Navigate to the RStudio download Website. Find the right version of the RStudio Desktop installer for your computer, download it and install the software. Open RStudio. Focus on the bottom left pane of the window, this is the “console” pane. Type getwd(). This prints out the path of the current working directory. Make a (mental) note where this is. We usually always need to change this “default directory” to a project directory. Set Up - Option 2 - Docker image with R/Rstudio Changing versions and environments are a continuing struggle with bioinformatics pipelines and computational pipelines in general. An analysis written and performed a year ago might not run or produce the same results when it is run today. Recording package and system versions or not updating certain packages rarely work in the long run. One the best solutions to reproducibility issues is containing your workflow or pipeline in its own coding environment where everything from the operating system, programs and packages are defined and can be built from a set of given instructions. There are many systems that offer this type of control including: Docker. Singularity “A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.” (???) Why are containers great for Bioiformatics? allows you to create environments to run bioinformatis pipelines. create a consistent environment to use for your pipelines. test modifications to the pipeline without disrupting your current set up. Coming back to an analysis years later and there is no need to install older versions of packages or programming languages. Simply create a container and re-run. What is docker? Docker is a container platform, similar to a virtual machine but better. We can run multiple containers on our docker server. A container is an instance of an image. The image is built based on a set of instructions but consists of an operating system, installed programs and packages. (When backing up your computer you might taken an image of it and restored your machine from this image. It the same concept but the image is built based on a set of elementary commands found in your Dockerfile.) - for overview see here Often images are built off of previous images with specific additions you need for you pipeline. (For example, for this course we use a base image supplied by bioconductorrelease 3.11 and comes by default with basic Bioconductor packages but it builds on the base R-docker images called rocker.) Docker - Basic term definition Container An instance of an image. the self-contained running system. There can be multiple containers derived from the same image. Image An image contains the blueprint of a container. In docker, the image is built from a Dockerfile Docker Volumes Anything written on a container will be erased when the container is erased ( or crashes) but anything written on a filesystem that is separate from the contain will persist even after a container is turned off. A volume is a way to assocaited data with a container that will persist even after the container. * maps a drive on the host system to a drive on the container. In the above docker run command (that creates our container) the statement: -v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/projects maps the directory ${PWD} to the directory /home/rstudio/projects on the container. Anything saved in /home/rstudio/projects will actually be saved in ${PWD} An example: I use the following commmand to create my docker container: docker run -e PASSWORD=changeit --rm \\ -v /Users/risserlin/code:/home/rstudio/projects \\ -p 8787:8787 \\ risserlin/workshop_base_image I create a notebook called task3.Rmd and save it in /home/rstudio/projects. Note: Do not save it in /home/rstudio/ which is the default directory RStudio will start in On my host computer, if I go to /Users/risserlin/code I will find the file task3.Rmd Install Docker Download and install docker desktop. Follow slightly different instructions for Windows or MacOS/Linux Windows it might prompt you to install additional updates (for example - https://docs.Microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package) and require multiple restarts of your system or docker. launch docker desktop app. Open windows Power shell navigate to directory on your system where you plan on keeping all your code. For example: C:\\USERS\\risserlin\\code Run the following command: (the only difference with the windows command is the way the current directory is written. ${PWD} instead of \"$(pwd)\") docker run -e PASSWORD=changeit --rm \\ -v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/projects -p 8787:8787 \\ risserlin/workshop_base_image Windows defender firewall might pop up with warning. Click on Allow access. In docker desktop you see all containers you are running and easily manage them. MacOS / Linux Open Terminal navigate to directory on your system where you plan on keeping all your code. For example: /Users/risserlin/code Run the following command: (the only difference with the windows command is the way the current directory is written. ${PWD} instead of \"$(pwd)\") docker run -e PASSWORD=changeit --rm \\ -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:/home/rstudio/projects -p 8787:8787 \\ risserlin/workshop_base_image Create your first notebook using Docker Start coding! Open a web browser to localhost:8787 enter username: rstudio enter password: changeit changing the parameter -e PASSWORD=changeit in the above docker command will change the password you need to specify When you go to localhost:8787 all you get is: Make sure your docker container is running. (If you rebooted your machine you will need to restart the container on reboot.) Make sure you got the right port. After logging in, you will see an Rstudio window just like when you install it directly on your computer. This RStudio will be running in your docker container and will be a completely separate instance from the one you have installed on your machine (with a different set of packages and potentially versions installed). Make sure that you have mapped a volume on your computer to a volume in your container so that files you create are also saved on your computer. That way, turning off or deleting your container or image will not effect your files. The parameter -v ${PWD}:/home/rstudio/projects maps your current directory (i.e. the directory you are in when launching the container) to the directory /home/rstudio/projects on your container. You do not need to use the ${PWD} convention. You can also specify the exact path of the directory you want to map to your container. Make sure to save all your scripts and notebooks in the projects directory. Create your first notebook in your docker Rstudio. Save it. Find your newly created file on your computer. Start using automation Download example R notebooks from https://github.com/BaderLab/Cytoscape_workflows. This repository contains example R Notebooks that automate the enrichment map pipeline. There are two ways you can download this collection: If you are familiar with git then we recommend you fork the repo and use it like you would use any github repo. download the collection as a zip file - unzip folder and place in CBW working directory If you are new to git and want to learn more about code versioning then we recommend you read the following tutorial And check out Github Desktop - a desktop application to communicate with github. Step 1 - launch RStudio Launch RStudio by double clicking on the installed program icon. Step 2 - create a new project Create a new project - File -&gt; New R Project … Select Create project from - “Existing Directory” Click on the Browse button Navigate to the EnrichmentMapPipeline directory that is found in the directory you downloaded and unzipped from github. (for example, if it is still in your downloads directory go to ~/Downloads/Cytoscape_workflows/EnrichmentMapPipelines) Step 3 - Open example up RNotebook Open the RNotebook Protocol2_createEM.Rmd Go to File –&gt; Open File … Click on Protocol2_createEM.Rmd If the file is not found in the first directory that RStudio opens up then go back and make sure that you created an Rproject from an “Existing directory” in the previous step. Step 4 - Define Notebook parameters Setting up Notebooks with parameters allows you to re-run the same notebook with different datasets very easily. Whereever possible create notebooks with parameters so you can re-use them Descriptions of each of the parameters: analysis_name - change this field to whatever you want your analysis to be called. GSEA directories generated will be named using this string. It will have additional characters added to it as GSEA generates a random number that it associates with each of its output directories. working_dir - path to directory containing the data files we will be analyzing. rnk_file - NOT Optional. This notebook runs GSEA preranked and this is the only file that is required. for details on the specifications of this file see Module 3 - gsea lab. class_file - (Optional) this file is a GSEA specific data file and is used for better visualization in the heat map viewer of enrichment map. For details of the creation of this file see - GSEA documentation - class files expression_file - (Optional) this file contains the expression values for each of the experiments used in to create your rank file. It is used for better visualization in the heat map viewer of enrichment map. run_gsea - set to yes or no. This variable specifies whether the notebook should run GSEA. GSEA can take a while to run so if you have already performed the GSEA analysis and simply want to create an enrichment map you can set this variable to “no”. If this variable is set to no then you need to specify the path and the name of the GSEA directory in “gsea_directory” parameter. gsea_jar - full path to the gsea jar. In the latest version of GSEA this is actually a bat(for windows users) or a sh (for moc and linux users) script. If using GSEA 3.0 or older set this variable to the full path to the gsea.jar We do not recommend using GSEA 3.0 or older versions gsea_directory - full path to gsea results directory. Only populate if run_gsea is set to “no”. fdr_threshold - FDR threshold used to create enrichment map pval_thresho - pvalue threshold used to create enrichment map java_version - for backwards compatibility. For users using previous version of GSEA and older versions of java. For this initial analysis change: gsea_jar - change to the full path to the gsea jar that you were instructed to download in your pre-workshop setup instructions This is not the same as the GSEA application that we used in Module 2 gsea lab. If you are using the docker implementation GSEA is already in the docker and you don’t need to downlaod anything else. Just set this parameter as: gsea_jar: /home/rstudio/GSEA_4.1.0/gsea-cli.sh Step 5 - Step through notebook to run the analysis The RNotebook is a mixture of markdown text and code blocks. Read through the notebook to understand what each section is doing and sequentially run the code blocks by clicking on the play button at the top right of each code block. Exercises Once you have run through the notebook and created your enrichment map automatically try the following: change the fdr threshold and create a new network (without rerunning the whole notebook) with the lower FDR threshold. change the similarity coeffecient and create a new network (without rerunning the whole notebook) with the lower FDR threshold. re-run the notebook using the GSEA results you created on the first run without running GSEA. Modify notebook to run with a different gmt file. (Downloaded from somewhere else or a different file found on baderlab genesets download site) Open the notebook Supplementary_Protocol5_Multi_dataset_theme_analysis.Rmd and run through it to create a multi dataset enrichment map. Additional resources Check out all the different notebooks available here A “wrapper” program uses another program’s functionality in its own context. RStudio is a wrapper for R since it does not duplicate R’s functions, it runs the actual R in the background.↩︎ "],["module-4-in-depth-analysis-of-networks-and-pathways.html", "Module 4: In-depth Analysis of Networks and Pathways", " Module 4: In-depth Analysis of Networks and Pathways Robin Haw Lecture Lab Lecture Lab practical Downloald GBM_genelist.txt file.

Dataset used during this practical lab ChIP-seq for RUNX1 from pools of mouse CD1 fetal ovaries (E14.5) NCBI GEO: GSE128767 From the paper: RUNX1 maintains the identity of the fetal ovary through an interplay with FOXL2 Nicol B, Grimm SA, Chalmel F, Lecluze E et al. Nat Commun 2019 Nov 11;10(1):5116. PMID: 31712577 Abstract: Sex determination of the gonads begins with fate specification of gonadal supporting cells into either ovarian granulosa cells or testicular Sertoli cells. This process of fate specification hinges on a balance of transcriptional control. We discovered that the transcription factor RUNX1 is enriched in the fetal ovary in rainbow trout, turtle, mouse, and human. In the mouse, RUNX1 marks the supporting cell lineage and becomes granulosa cell-specific as the gonads differentiate. RUNX1 plays complementary/redundant roles with FOXL2 to maintain fetal granulosa cell identity, and combined loss of RUNX1 and FOXL2 results in masculinization of the fetal ovaries. To determine whether interplay between RUNX1 and FOXL2 occurs at the chromatin level, we performed genome-wide analysis of RUNX1 chromatin occupancy in E14.5 ovaries. The top de novo motif identified in RUNX1 ChIP-seq matched the RUNX motif. We found that RUNX1 chromatin occupancy was partially overlapping with FOXL2 chromatin occupancy in fetal ovaries. Figure 1 They found that RUNX1 is expressed in the fetal ovary at day 14 in mice and that it is necessary for a good development of the ovary. Figure 2 A KO of Runx1 and another TF Foxl2 abolished the normal development of the ovary. Why did we choose this dataset? RUNX1 is a transcription factor that is interesting to study as it has major biological functions. chIP-seq peaks are stored in a bed file that can be download from GEO entry. Linked to transcriptomic data GSE129038 Quality of the data The first piece of information that we need to get before starting the analysis is the model organism and genome version. * In the main GEO entry GSE128767 * click on one of the samples (for example - GSM3684638). * On the sample page scroll down to the “Data processing” section * The organism is mus musculus and the reference genome is mm10 * 3 files are available from the GEO entry (see below). The bed file provided by the authors (GSE128767_RUNX1_ChIP.peaks.bed) (linked on the main dataset page under supplementary file - GSE128767 ) has the right format to be used by GREAT for the pathway analysis; The first 3 fields contain the chromosome name, start and end. They are the 3 required fields. The fourth column is optional and consists of the chromosomal position, followed by MACS2 score value and FDR. Figure 3 - Dataset BED file Figure 4 - Example view of BED file Exercise 1 - Run pathway analysis using GREAT Perform pathway enrichment Open a web browser and go to http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/ In “Species Assembly”, choose Mouse: GRCm38(UCSC mm10, Dec. 2011) In “Test regions”, Click on “Choose file” and locate the file GSE128767_RUNX1_ChIP.peaks.bed that you save on your computer. Figure 5 - GREAT interface In “Association rule settings” , click on “Show settings” to see the current rule set to associate genes to peaks Figure 6 - GREAT Association rules used in analysis Do not change the settings. We are doing a distal analysis where genes (genomic regions) are associated with peaks within 5k upstream of the transcription start site of the genes (TSS), 1kb downstream and up to 1000 kb to nearest gene. Click on the “Submit” button at the end of the page Explore the results. Expand the “Job Description” tab to check the parameters, Figure 7 - Job Description click on “View all genomic region-gene associations” (blue font) In a new tab there will be 2 tables containing the list of the chIP-seq peaks and corresponding associated genes. Download both of the tables (region -&gt; gene and gene -&gt; region) Figure 8 - genomic region-gene association tables. Return to the main GREAT results page. In the “Region-Gene Association Graphs”, we can see that the peaks were mainly associated with genes located +-5kb of the TSS in addition to the presence of some distal peaks as expected based on the association rule that we have used. Figure 9 - Region-gene association graphs Let’s explore the pathway analysis results and look at the GO Biological Process table. scroll down to the “GO Biological Process” section. Figure 10 - GO Biological Process results As we defined a distal rule to associate peaks with genes, we are going to look at the binomial FDR. The binomial test assesses whether the number of genomic regions annotated with the tested pathway is significantly larger than the number of genomic regions not annotated with the tested pathway. The fold enrichment is the proportion of genomic regions annotated with the tested pathway and genomic regions not annotated with the tested pathway. Export the GO BP result on your local computer: Under the “GO Biological Process” title, locate the “Table controls:” select the option “All ontology data as .tsv”. A file called greatExportAll.tsv will be saved on your computer. Rename the file “Distal_GOBP_greatExportAll.tsv”. We will import this file later in Cytoscape/EnrichmentMap. Figure 11 - Download Go Biological Process results Perform pathway enrichment - Proximal approach We are now trying a proximal approach to define genes associated with peaks. Go back to the main GREAT page. Make sure the bed file is still uploaded and the genome is set to mm10. Locate the “Association rule settings” and click on “Show settings”. Set Proximal 1kb upstream, 1kb downstream plus Distal up to 1kb . Uncheck the “Include curated regulatory domains” box. Figure 12 - GREAT Association rules used in proximal analysis Click on Submit. Explore the results. - proximal analysis In the “Region-Gene Association Graphs” , we can see that using the proximal rule in our settings, genes are associated with peaks that are all within the +-5kb rule (in fact the +-1kb rule) and there are no more distal peaks. Figure 13 - Proximal Region-gene association graphs Explore the GOBP results and export the results on your computer. Figure 14 - Proximal GO BP results Using this rule, genes will be associated with peaks only if they are within 1kb of the transcription start site of the genes. It reduces the problem to a gene list and in this case, a Fisher’s exact (Hyper FDR Q-Val) test can be applied to test for pathway enrichment. Export the GO BP result on your local computer: Under the “GO Biological Process” title, locate the “Table controls:” select the option “All ontology data as .tsv”. A file called greatExportAll.tsv will be saved on your computer. Rename the file “Proximal_GOBP_greatExportAll.tsv”. We will import this file later in Cytoscape/EnrichmentMap. Figure 15 - Export Proximal GOBP enrichment results Exercise 2 - Build an enrichment map to visualize GREAT results Open Cytoscape In the menu bar, select Apps –&gt; EnrichmentMap Drag and drop the GREAT result file Distal_GOBP_greatExportAll.tsv into the DataSet box. Set the FDR q value cut-off to 0.001 Click on Build Figure 16 - Enrichment map input panel A “Set Parameters” dialog box opens: Choose “Binomial p-value”. Figure 17 - Statistical Test choice panel Explore the map. Figure 18 - Enrichment map with distal enriched pathways Exercise 3 (optional): Auto-annotate the distal enrichment map, build the proximal map and compare both the proximal and distal maps Optional exercise 3a: AutoAnnotate the enrichment map: In the menu bar, select Apps and then AutoAnnotate. A dialog box opens. Click on “Create Annotations”. Arrange the display by clicking on each module name listed in the right panel and then move them apart from the other modules using a mouse or a trackpad. What are the main biological functions enriched in genes associated with RUNX1 peaks? Is it relevant in relation to what we know about the role of RUNX1 in development? Optional exercise 3b: Repeat the process of building an enrichment map using the proximal data (Proximal_GOBP_greatExportAll.tsv). Because this is proximal data, the problem is reduced to a gene list and you can use the Fisher’s exact test (FDR 0.001) to looked at the enrichment results Optional exercise 3c: Repeat the process by building both the Proximal and Distal enrichment maps at the same time. Drag both files in the EnrichmentMap input box. Use FDR 0.0001 for both and binomial test. Check which nodes are in common between the 2 datasets. Color the data by datasets. Exercise 4: Add RUNX1 targets and RUNX1 KO up and down regulated genes on the distal enrichment map as a new gene-set. During this exercise, we will connect the proximal chIP-seq enrichment map with the RUNX1 targets as well as the genes that are dysregulated after RUNX1 KO. We have already created a .gmt file that contains these gene lists (RUNX1_Affy.gmt). The format of a .gmt file is a tab delimited text file with one row per gene-set. Each gene-set contains the name of the gene-set, a description of the gene-set followed by the names of the genes. The file extension is changed from .txt to .gmt. Figure 20 - example of gmt file Note: We extracted the RUNX1 targets using the iRegulon Cytoscape app and the optional exercise 6 describes the steps. We extracted 200 genes to build the RUNX1 target gene list. This RUNX1 study had transcriptomics data (microarray) in addition to the chIP-seq data. The microarray data gives an overview of all genes that are changing between a fetal ovary with normal development and a fetal ovary after RUNX1 knock-out (KO) (GSE129038). We have used the tool GEO2R to get the top 500 up and down regulated genes (see description of the steps at the end the document). step 4a: Add the .gmt file to the enrichment map: Go to the EnrichmentMap tab Make sure that the Distal_GOBP_greatExportAll network is selected. click on “Add Signature Gene Sets…”. Figure 21 - Add Signature sets Click on “Load from File….” located on the right hand size and select the file “RUNX1_Affy.gmt” that you have saved on your computer. Set “Test” to “Hypergeometric Test” with the “Cutoff” set to 0.05. Click on “finish” Figure 22 - Signature sets input panel The 3 gene-sets are now added to the map. Each line (edge) shows pathways that have genes in common with the signature gene-sets. Step 4b Optional: Change the edge style of the signature gene-sets: Click on one signature gene-set node on the map to select it (it should appear in yellow). In the Cytoscape menu bar, click “Select” –&gt; “Edges” –&gt;“Select Adjacent Edges” Figure 23 - Select adjacent edges Go to “Style” and in the “Edge” table, in the bypass column Byp. , click on the box and select a color. Figure 24 - Bypass selected edge color Repeat for all genes: In “ Style” and in the “Edge” table, go to Width and set Column to “EM k_Intersection” Figure 25 - Final figure Exercise 5: Learning how to run MEME-chip from the MEME suite (https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme-chip) Format the Data MEME suite accepts sequences as input and not chromosome coordinates. The bed file contains the chromosome coordinates of the peaks. Therefore, we first need to fetch all the peak sequences. UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) has some tools to help us. If needed, you can use the finalized formatted file GSE128767_RUNX1_ChIP.peaks.fasta but we encourage you to follow the below steps to learn how to do it yourself. The step that we took to create it are described below and were adapted from https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/cshl/stubbs/meme-ex/meme.html. Exercise 5a: Download sequences from .bed coordinates Open the UCSC browser main page (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). Click on Genomes in the menu bar and select Mouse GRCm38/mm10. The UCSC Genome Browser window opens in a new tab. Below the tracks, click on the button add custom tracks. A new window will open. UCSC genome browser Upload the bed file GSE128767_RUNX1_ChIP.peaks.bed; press the “Submit” button. meme3 A new window will appear with your updated track. Make sure that “Table Browser” is selected and click on go. meme4 A new window will appear. Select sequence as output format and plain text as file type returned. Click on get output. A new window will open where you can choose various options for your sequence (e.g. repeat masking). Note that for meme and similar programs it is important to “mask repeats” to “N”; otherwise, sequences in repetitive elements will dominate your motif list. Select Mask repeats next to Mask repeats change option to to N click on Get sequences meme6 A fasta file will appear; save this as plain text (copy and paste in a text editor or right click on the page and select Save As… and save the file to your computer). You will need to modify the UCSC header that comes with the sequences to use them for meme: Go to https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/clean_fasta.html upload or copy and paste the plain text file from the above step check Extract CHR:coordinates from UCSC Click on “Clean Sequence” Save this as plain text under the name GSE128767_RUNX1_ChIP.peaks.fasta (copy and paste in a text editor or right click and Save as will not work for this file) - it will look like the below file. Exercise 5b: Run MEME-chIP Open https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme-chip. Expand Motif Discovery Click on MEME-Chip meme9 Under Input the primary sequences box, upload the file GSE128767_RUNX1_ChIP.peaks.fasta . Click on Start Search. Important: Save the url so you can access your result later even if you close the MEME window. For example my url is - https://meme-suite.org/meme/info/status?service=MEMECHIP&amp;id=appMEMECHIP_5.3.31620409506563-973419203 MEME-ChIP will run for about 1 hour: look at the results below from the MEME-chip result, try to answer the questions and follow next steps. Check your MEME-ChIP results at the end of the practical lab. When your job is complete you should see the following page on your saved link: results of the top motifs that were found significantly enriched in the peak sequences. meme13 To which transcription factor does it correspond? Why is the centered distribution of the motif important (what does it mean)? Exercise 6 (optional): Get the iRegulon RUNX1 targets and find the mouse orthologs using g:Orth (from g:Profiler) to create the gmt file used in Exercise 4.

By Veronique Voisin iRegulon lab Goal Import a Cytoscape network and apply iRegulon on all the selected nodes. Explore and understand the main output features of iRegulon such as the Transcription target view. Learn how to display predicted targets of a specific transcription factor by creating its metatargetome. This practical consists of 2 exercises. Follow the step-by-step checklist trough the exercises. Some notes about iRegulon and information about the output values are written at the end of the document. Before starting the exercises, download the files: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. prostate_cancer_genemania_network.txt in case the iRegulon server is not working, it is possible to work with precomputed results. Please look at the instructions at the bottom of this page. Exercise 1. Detect regulons from co-expressed genes In this exercise, we are using genes frequently mutated in prostate cancer. iRegulon requires a network from the start, and we will use a GeneMANIA network that we previously saved for this purpose. Using iRegulon, we will look for transcription factors (TFs) that may regulate a set of genes in this network. Note: iRegulon also accepts a simple gene list as input to create the network To start this exercise, download to your computer the prostate_cancer_genemania_network.txt file. Skills learned in this exercise: Create a network by importing a text file, run iRegulon to detect regulons, explore the iRegulon results, create a regulon subnetwork, save the results. Steps Launch Cytoscape. Close the “Welcome to Cytoscape” window, if it’s enabled. Double click on the . Cytoscape icon. Create a network using the ‘prostate_cancer_genemania_network.txt’ file. ● In the menu bar select ‘File &gt; Import &gt; Network &gt;File…. A file open dialog pops up. gp1_2a ● Browse and locate the prostate_cancer_genemania_network.txt’ file. Click the ‘Open’ button. An “Import Network From Table” dialog pops up. 2b ● Select the column ‘Entity 1’ . ● Expand the menu using the arrow on the right and click the green circle button to set this column as ‘Source Node’. 2c ● Select the column ‘Entity 2’. ● Click the red bullseye to set this column as ‘Target Node’. 2d ● Click the ‘OK’ button. The main window now displays the created network. Each node represents a gene. Edges represent the relationships (e.g physical interactions, co-expression) between the genes (nodes) that were calculated by GeneMANIA. 2e The shortcut ⌘+L (Mac) or Ctrl+L (Windows) is a quicker way to import a network from a file. If you only see gray nodes, go to Style and choose default style. Improve the layout. ● In the menu bar, select Layout &gt; Files Layouts &gt; Organic ( you need to install the yFiles layout algorithms app in Cytoscape app manager) gp1_3a gp1_3b Select all nodes in the network. To do this using the mouse, click shift and drag from an empty space to the left of and above every node to an empty space to the right of and beneath every node. The selected nodes are now colored yellow. In the menu bar, select Apps &gt; iRegulon &gt; Predict regulators and targets.A ‘Predict regulators and targets’ dialog pops up. ● Using the default parameters, click the ‘Submit’ button at the bottom of the page.A progress bar will pop up. ● Wait until the running analysis is completed (usually less than 1 min). The progress bar will vanish, and a new right panel, “Results Panel” will be added to the main Cytoscape window. ● Deselect all nodes by clicking on a blank space of the screen. The nodes are all cyan again. 5a 5b Explore the results. ● Locate the ‘Results Panel’ on the right side of the window. ● Click on the ‘float window’ icon located at the upper right corner. resize the ‘Result Panel’ window by expanding it horizontally and vertically, so you can see the results and the network simultaneously. mouse over column names to get a tooltip describing their meaning in more detail. 6 Explore the enrichment results in the Motifs tab from the Results Panel. It is a list of all DNA binding motifs that appear in more than one gene region from the prostate cancer gene list. They are ranked by the strongest Normalized Enrichment Score (NES). Some DNA binding motifs in the databases are related to a specific transcription factor, but others are not. ● Check that ‘Motifs’ is the selected tab of the ‘Results Panel’. ● Click on the row for this motif to display the motif’s sequence logo and related information at the bottom part of Results Panel. On the above screenshot, there is an enrichment in the prostate gene list for a motif called YOL108C from the yetfasco database. The motif logo is displayed and it is very similar to the MITF binding motif. The genes from our network carrying this motif in their promoter region are indicated in red (TargetName). The rank indicates the number of motifs that they carry in their promoter region. Additional explanation about the results are located at the end of this document and in more detail in the iRegulon reference paper. Explore the enrichment results in the Tracks tab. It is a list of all ChIP-seq datasets (or “tracks”) sorted by strongest enrichment from genes inour network. ● Select the ‘Tracks’ tab of the ‘Results Panel’. ● Find a ‘ClusterCode’ assigned to more than one track. T4 is a track cluster associated with 2 tracks and is highlighted in the table as an example.The 2 tracks are biological replicates (Rep1, Rep2) of a same chIP-seq experiment. The transcription factor used for this chIP_seq experiment is TCF12. The first track is ranked number 4 and the second track is ranked number 8. The genes with TCF12 peaks in their promoter regions are listed in red under “TargetName”. Explore the enrichment results in the Transcription Factors tabview. This is the most important tab as each row is a transcription factor that is a potential co-regulator of the genes in our network. Each row represents a cluster that combines the results of the related motifs (Motifs tab) or tracks (Tracks tab) or both. ● Select the ‘Transcription Factors’ tab of the ‘Results Panels’. ● Click on ‘MTF1’ and explore the results. 9 MTF1 is associated with the motif cluster M1. This cluster contains 6 related motifs and 11 potential target genes. One motif (homer-M00129) selected as example in the above screenshot is directly annotated to the TFs NRF1 and ZSCAN10 as indicated by green checked signs. How did iRegulon perform? Is MTF1 (metal-transcription factor 1) known to be expressed or to play a role in prostate cancer? Open your web browser and search the web for [MTF1 “prostate cancer”]. 10 This network highlights MTF1 and interactions with other genes and miRs. This is a network involved in prostate cancer. PMID:14568174 PMID:23157640 Add MTF1 to the network. ● Check that the Transcription Factors tab is selected. ● Click the MTF1 row to select it. ● Click the ‘Add regulator’ icon located at the upper left corner of the ‘Results Panel’. This adds MTF1 to the network as a yellow node, with the edges linking to its 11 potential targets, all highlighted as purple nodes. 11a) 11a 11b) Create a subnetwork to better visualize the predicted targets. ● Select the MTF1 node in the network by clicking on it. ● In the Cytoscape toolbar above the network, click the ‘First Neighbors of Selected Nodes’ icon . MTF1 and its targets are now highlighted in yellow (which means they are selected). ● Use the ‘New network from selection’ icon to create a subnetwork. 12a) 12b) If the node colors are not purple, go to Style and choose ‘iRegulon Visual Style’. gp1_12c Add to the figure information on the types of interactions obtained from GeneMANIA and stored as additional information in the ‘prostate_cancer_genemania_network.txt’ file. ● In the Control Panel at the left of the window, select the ‘Style’ tab. At the bottom of the panel, select the ‘Edge’ tab. ● Locate the ‘Stroke Color’ property and click the right triangle to expand the box. ● Change the ‘Column’ field to ‘Network group’ ● Verify that the ‘Mapping Type’ field is ‘Discrete Mapping’ ● For the first interaction type, choose a color by clicking on the ‘Edit color’ button on the right side of the color field. Choose a color and click the ‘OK’ button. ● Repeat that step, choosing a different color for each interaction type. The edges should now be colored by the types of interactions. 13a) gp1_13a 13b) gp1_13b Save current results as an iRegulon (iRF) file. ● In the ‘Results Panel’ toolbar, click the ‘Save current results as an iRegulon (iRF) file’ button .. ● Choose a name and click the ‘Save’ button. you can reuse these iRegulon results by loading this iRF file using the ‘Load saved results’ icon .. 14a) 14 Save the Cytoscape session . ● In the Cytoscape menu bar, select File &gt; Save as. ● Choose a name and click the ‘Save’ button. you can re-open this file later to examine the network further. 15 Exercise 2. Create a metatargetome using iRegulon and merge 2 networks in Cytoscape. This exercise does not require additional files. This exercise will teach you to use the metatargetome function of iRegulon. This function displays a list of potential targets for a specific TF. We will create the metatargetome of two TFs, that we found as potential coregulators of the prostate cancer genes (exercise 1): MTF1 and LARP4. We will then learn how to use Cytoscape to merge two networks and visualize nodes in common. Steps Launch Cytoscape. If Cytoscape is already opened, do File &gt; New &gt; Session. A ‘Current session will be lost. Do you want to continue?’ dialog opens. Click on ‘OK’. Double click on the Cytoscape icon. Create the metatargetome for MTF1. ● From the menu bar , select File &gt; Apps &gt; iRegulon&gt; Query TF-target database.A ‘Query TF-target database for a factor’ window pops up. ● In the ‘Transcription Factor’ field, select ‘MTF1’. ● Set Network &gt; ‘Number nodes (approx.)’ to 100. ● Click the ‘Submit’ button. 2a) 2a2 2b) 2b2 2c) 2c2 Create the metatargetome for LARP4. Follow same steps as above. ● From the Cytoscape menu bar, select File &gt; Apps&gt;iRegulon&gt; Query TF-target database. ● A ‘Query TF-target database for a factor’ window pops up. In the ‘Transcription Factor field’, enter ‘LARP4’. ● Set Network &gt; ‘Number nodes (approx.)’ to 100. ● Click the ‘Submit’ button. 3a) 3a2 3b) 3b2 Merge the two networks to visualize their shared target genes. From the Cytoscape menu bar, select Tools &gt; Merge &gt; Networks….An ‘Advanced Network Merge’ window pops up. ● Check that the ‘Union’ option is selected. ● In the ‘Available Networks’ list, select ‘Metatargetome for LARP4’. ● Hold down the shift key while selecting ‘Metatargetome for MTF1’ so both networks are selected. ● Click the right arrow to move the networks to the ‘Networks to Merge’ list. ● Click the ‘Merge’ button. Cytoscape now displays the two networks in the same window, linked by the two genes they have in common. 4a) 4a2 4b) 4b2 4c) 4c2 END OF EXERCISE Use or precomputed iRegulon results: Download these files on your computer: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. prostate_cancer_genemania_network.cys iregulon_results.irf launch Cytoscape open the “prostate_cancer_genemania_network.cys” file go to App &gt; iRegulon &gt; ‘Load results from the iregulon_results.irf file’ Notes about iRegulon: Website: http://iregulon.aertslab.org/ Tutorials: http://iregulon.aertslab.org/tutorial.html#clusters Paper: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003731 [PMID:25058159] Motif oriented view: Each line is a DNA binding motif those sequence has been located in 20 kb regions centered around the TSS (transcription start site) of genes from the prostate cancer list (= genes in the network). The genes from the network which contained this DNA binding motif are called the target genes and displayed in the ‘Target Name’ column. Their ranks are also indicated. DNA binding motifs more usually represent a family of transcription factors (e.g. helix loop helix TFs ) rather than being specific to one particular TF. In addition, related TFs (e.g GATA1, GATA2, GATA3) can bind to very similar DNA sequences. iRegulon uses the motif2TF algorithm to associate a motif with a specific TF. The ‘#TF’ column indicates which motifs are significantly associated to a TF (# &gt;= 1) or not (# = 0). Clicking on a motif line will display a panel indicating several related information. It will display all the TFs found significantly associated with the motif. How is the enrichment calculated? (NES AUC) motif detection and enrichment score in a set of input genes. iRegulon uses precomputed results to calculate for each motif the AUC (Area Under the cumulative Recovery Curve) and the NES (Normalized Enrichment Score). iRegulon accesses this database of precomputed results using a server connection when a search is launched. What are these precomputed results : iRegulon gathered known DNA binding motifs and their corresponding PWM (position weight matrix, see lecture) from different databases (eg TRANSFAC pro) (9713 PWMs). They then ranked all genes in the genome (22284 genes) for each motif from the most likely target of this motif to the least one (available for Human, Mouse and Drosophila). Calculating enrichment for our set of genes (our network) : Each ranked list (each motif) is then tested with our set of genes to see whether genes in our list are located more at the top of the ranked list (most likely targets of the motifs). From this ranked list and the overlap with our gene list, the AUC (Area Under the cumulative Recovery Curve) is calculated for each motif. The AUC is going to be larger if we have more genes at the top of our list. The higher the AUC values and the higher the tested motif is likely to co-regulate our genes (or some of them). The NES is derived from the AUC. The optimal subset of highly ranked lists are set as the potential target genes and displayed in the ‘target name’ column. How are several motifs being similarly grouped under a same cluster code? To find TF associated with motifs, iRegulon uses the motif2TF algorithm. During this computation of motif2TF, motifs sharing similarities are grouped together and form a cluster. Within this cluster, some motifs are already known to correspond to a specific TF (direct annotation). This information is used to associate a motif with one or more related TFs. The ‘ClusterCode’ column indicates the cluster assigned to each motif. Tracks oriented view: Each line is an ENCODE Chip_Seq track. Chip_seq are sequencing of fragments bound to a specific TF after immunoprecipitation of the TF and the DNA fragments. Each track is then specific to a transcription factor (the #TFs columns is always equal to 1). Clusters contain more than one track only if these tracks were generated using the same TF. All the values (NES, AUC,… are the same for the motif, track of transcription factor oriented views. Transcription Factors oriented view: Each line is a cluster of motifs and or tracks and as the next column (TF) the best representative TF of this cluster determined by the motif2TF algorithm. All the values (NES, AUC,… are the same for the motif, track of transcription factor oriented views. Metatargetome: iRegulon uses the pre-computed results not only for finding regulons but also for displaying the potential gene targets for any TF of interest available in the iRegulon database. Users can define the number of top potential targets they want to display. The result is visualized as a network using a circular layout with the TF of interest in the center of the network. Notes about Cytoscape: Link to tutorials showing how to format data to create a Cytoscape network starting from a simple gene list: http://wiki.cytoscape.org/Cytoscape_User_Manual/Network_Formats Note about organic layout: “The organic layout style is based on the force-directed layout paradigm. When calculating a layout, the nodes are considered to be physical objects with mutually repulsive forces, like, e.g., protons or electrons. The connections between nodes also follow the physical analogy and are considered to be springs attached to the pair of nodes. … The layout algorithm simulates these physical forces and rearranges the positions of the nodes in such a way that the sum of the forces emitted by the nodes and the edges reaches a (local) minimum. Resulting layouts often expose the inherent symmetric and clustered structure of a graph, they show a well-balanced distribution of nodes and have few edge crossings.” http://docs.yworks.com/yfiles/doc/developers-guide/smart_organic_layouter.html . Exercise 3. Use Enrichr with the prostate gene list. Before starting the exercise, download the files: prostate_genelist.csv TRRUST_Transcription_Factors_2019_table.txt TTRUST_rank.xlsx Goal Use Enrichr on the prostate gene list and explore which transcription factors were predicted to be regulator on the same gene list used for the iRegulon lab. After exploring the Enrichr results, we are going to export it into Cytoscape/EnrichmentMap. This is another opportunity to learn how to create a network and modify its style. Steps Launch Enrichr on a web browser using this address: https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/ In the input data window, copy and paste the genes from the prostate gene list enrichr1.png Click on the ‘Submit’ button The results are now displayed. Check that the ‘Transcription’ tab is the one selected. ● Explore the results from the different gene-set libraries on your own (CHEA 2016, TRANSFAC and JASPAR PWMs, etc…) . Then, click on the gene-set library called “TRRUST Transcription Factors 2019” ● TRRUST (https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/) is a manually curated database of human and mouse transcriptional regulatory networks. Each gene-set contained some target genes for a particular transcription factor. It contains mouse and human data. They have been derived from pubmed articles which describe small-scale experimental studies of transcriptional regulations. ● We are going to explore the result in this library as some gene-sets are significantly enriched at FDR &lt; 0.05. enrichr3.png ● The observation of the bar graph indicates that the transcription factor NR5A1 is the most significant result. Click on the ‘Table’ to display the results as a table. enrichr4.png ● Remember from the presentation that the Adjusted p-value represents the FDR. As the FDR is less than 0.05, all these gene-sets are significantly enriched in our gene list. Click on the ‘Export entries to table’. Open the file that was downloaded on your computer in excel. enrichr5.png ● This table contains all the gene-sets significantly enriched or not. ● The ‘Term’ column contains the name of the transcription factors and the last column ‘Genes’ contains the list of genes that are the targets of these transcription factors. All these genes are the ones present in the prostate gene list. The overlap 8/22 means that 22 genes are the known target of NR5A1 and 8 are present in the prostate gene list. ● We are going to use this table to create an enrichment map in Cytoscape. Open Cytoscape. Click in the menu bar on ‘Apps’ and ‘EnrichmentMap’. A ‘Create Enrichment Map’ dialog box opens. Drag and drop the TRRUST_Transcription_Factors_2019_table.txt in the ‘Data Sets’ window. ● On the right, check that the “Analysis Type” is set to “Generic/gProfiler/Enrichr”. ● Set the ‘FDR q-value cutoff’ at 0.05. enrichr6.png Click on the ‘Build’ button. An enrichment map is now created. ● The nodes are the transcription factor gene-sets. You can click on a node to see the genes that are the targets of these transcription factors. Transcription factors are connected by edges if they have target genes in common. Modify the visual style ● In the EnrichmentMap tab on the right, locate ‘Style’ and set “Chart Data” to ‘–None–’. Import a file ● Our goal is to adjust node size and node color relatively to the gene-set enrichment results. To make it easier, a file has been created for you that ranks the gene-sets from 1 to 98 in the order of the adjusted p values. We will import this file in Cytoscape as a node table. ● To import the file, locate ‘File’ in the Cytoscape menu bar and then ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Table from File’. enrichr9.png ● Browse your computer to find the file TTRUST_rank.xlsx that you have downloaded at the beginning of part 3 and click ‘Open’. ● An ‘Import Columns From Table’ dialog box opens. Click on ‘OK’. enrichr11.png Play with the visual style ● Locate the Cytoscape ‘Style’ tab enrichr10.png ● Locate the ‘Cytoscape ’Style’ tab ‘Fill Color’ property in the Node tab and expand the tab using the arrow on the right ● Remove the current mapping using the trash can icon. enrichr12.png ● In ‘Column’, choose “myrank” and in ‘Mapping Type’, choose ‘Continuous Mapping’. enrichr13.png ● Locate the ‘Size’ property and expand the tab using the arrow on the right ● Remove the current mapping using the trash can icon. enrichr14.png ● In ‘Column’, choose “myrank” and in ‘Mapping Type’, choose ‘Continuous Mapping’. ● Set high node size values for low rank and low node size for high rank enrichr15.png ● The enrichment map shows now in yellow and large nodes the transcription factors that were the most significantly enriched (based on the adjusted p value ranking). It also shows the links to the other gene-sets. ● NR5A1 (the most significant gene-set) is indeed known to be associated with prostate cancer. The prostate is a hormone-dependent organ. NR5A1 is a steroid nuclear receptor and has now been reported to be expressed in aggressive forms of prostate cancer (https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/155/2/358/2423115). end of practical lab Congratulations!

By Quaid Morris and Veronique Voisin Goal of this practical lab Create GeneMANIA networks starting from a single gene to predict its function or starting from a gene list. Explore and understand the main output features of GeneMANIA such as the network composition or the enriched functions. This practical consists of 3 exercises. Before starting the exercises,download the files: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place it in the corresponding module directory of your CBW work directory. 30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt Mixed_gene_list.txt CYP11B_pearson_correlation_prostate.txt Network layouts are flexible and can be rearranged. What you see when you perform these exercises may not be identical to what you see in the tutorial, or what you have seen other times that you have performed the exercises. Exact layouts and predictions can also be affected by updates to the networks database that GeneMANIA uses. However it is expected that the network weights and predicted genes will be similar to those shown here. EXERCISE 1: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW Imagine that you are interested in exploring the function of the human GRN gene: GRN returned as the strongest hit from your omics experiment but not many information about this gene is available in functional databases. Use GeneMANIA to identify its predicted function as well as potential interaction partners. Skills: GeneMANIA Single Gene search; Navigating Search Results; Exploring available Genes features; Rerun a new analysis using a single gene or multiple genes query from the network. STEPS Open Cytoscape. Locate the GeneMANIA search window located on the left side in Control Panel. In the search window, ensure that the model organism is set to Homo sapiens . Enter the following gene: GRN Click on the search icon and wait for the results. When your search results load, examine the network. Genes you searched with are indicated in black, related genes added by GeneMANIA are represented in gray, and colored links represent the interactions that connect the nodes (genes). zoom in and zoom out using trackpad or mouse scrolling up and down. Locate the Functions summary tab in Results Panel. What are the functions significantly associated with this network? GRN is the central node of this network: which function would you predict for GRN? How well did GeneMANIA perform (hints: use GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/) , PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/))? EXERCISE 1 ANSWERS Question What are the functions significantly associated with this network? Answer the list of the functions associated with the network are listed in the above screenshot. “lysosomal function”, “vacuolar lumen”, “vacuolar part” are significant under a FDR threshold less than 0.0001. Question GRN is the central node of this network: which function would you predict for GRN? Answer : a function related to lysosome and vacuole Question How well did GeneMANIA perform (hints: use GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/) , PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/))? Answer The top functions predicted by GeneMANIA for GRN were related to lysosome and vacuole. A pubmed search could confirm these results: “We experimentally verified that granulin precursor (GRN) gene, whose mutations cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is involved in lysosome function.” (Transcriptional gene network inference from a massive dataset elucidates transcriptome organization and gene function. Belcastro et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Nov 1;39(20):8677-88. 2011. PMID:21785136) Locate the gene with the strongest association with GRN. this gene is the largest node on the network. Answer is SORT1 Re-run an analysis by adding SORT1, HSPG2 to the search. Type ‘SORT1’ and ‘HSPG2’ in the search box that already contains ‘GRN’ (one gene per line). Click on the search button. Which functions are associated with this new network? Save the network as an image by clicking on ‘File’, ‘Export’, ‘Network to Image…’ and setting the “Export File Format” to “PDF(*.pdf)”. Notes about biological interpretation of the results: A paper describing the interaction between GRN and SORT1 and demonstrates how finding related genes could be relevant for elaborating therapy: Targeted manipulation of the sortilin–progranulin axis rescues progranulin haploinsufficiency. Lee et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2014 March 15; 23(6): 1467–1478. Published online 2013 October 26. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddt534. PMCID:PMC3929086 “Progranulin (GRN) mutations causing haploinsufficiency are a major cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). Recent discoveries demonstrating sortilin (SORT1) is a neuronal receptor for PGRN endocytosis and a determinant of plasma PGRN levels portend the development of enhancers targeting the SORT1–PGRN axis. We demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of several approaches through which impairing PGRN’s interaction with SORT1 restores extracellular PGRN levels. “ GM11 EXERCISE 2: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW To start this exercise, you need to download the 30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt file from the course wiki and save it on your computer. For this exercise, you are working with a list of 30 prostate cancer genes. This list can be downloaded after the workshop from the cBioPortal website (http://www.cbioportal.org/) under the download section, user defined list. The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics stores genomic data from large scale, integrated cancer genomic data sets. During this exercise, you will explore the types of networks that have been used to create the GeneMANIA network from the prostate cancer gene list and you will see how changing input parameters can affect the results. The last step of the exercise consists of uploading a custom network which is a list of genes that are positively correlated with CYP11B1 in mRNA expression data of 94 prostate cancer samples (http://www.cbioportal.org/) . Skills: GeneMANIA search using a gene list; Navigating Search Results; Exploring Networks and advanced options; Uploading a custom network. STEPS Open Cytoscape. Locate the GeneMANIA search window located on the left side in Control Panel. Copy and paste genes in the file 30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt. Make sure that the parameter ‘Max resultant genes’ is set to ‘20’ by clicking on the menu button at the right side of the search box and selecting ‘Customise advanced options’. Click on the search icon and wait for the results. check that the parameter ‘Max resultant genes’ is set to ‘20’: When your search results load, examine the network. Genes you searched with are indicated in black, related genes added by GeneMANIA are represented in gray, and colored links represent the interactions that connect the nodes (genes). Move nodes around by selecting them with a mouse to investigate how they are connected. Click any link (edge) connecting two nodes to highlight information about it. The information about the interaction is display in the Edge Table located in Table Panel (at the bottom) in the networks and data type columns. Note: Clicking on an edge between 2 nodes will display information about all interaction networks that connect these 2 nodes. It indicates the reference (publication) for these interactions. The colors indicate the type of interaction (co-expression, shared protein domains, co-localization, physical interactions and predicted). Locate and expand the ‘Networks’ summary tab in Results Panel (on the right) and look at what data has been used to create the network and predictions. Note that Co-expression (purple colored lines, weight over 25%) and Shared protein domains (lightgold colored lines, weight over 30%) influence the results the most, but Co-localization (blue colored lines), Physical interactions (salmon colored lines) and Predicted (orange) data are also included. At the top of the Networks summary tab, use the menu button and try Expand “All, then “Top-Level” and “None” to get information about the sources of the different networks. Highlight all connections corresponding to each network by clicking the name of each network category. Click on “Shared protein domains” and see which genes are connected by predicted protein protein interaction. You can do the same for “Co-localization” , “Co-expression” and “Physical interactions”. these observations of the number of connections make it easier to understand why co-expression and shared protein domains get the higher percent weight on this network: they are helping to connect more genes than physical interactions and predicted; A higher weight means that this network helped more to find related genes. Locate the Functions summary tab and look at what functions were significantly enriched in this list of prostate genes. The top pathways with the strongest enrichments are: “cellular hormone metabolic process” with 23 genes in the list overlapping with this pathway. The FDR is equal to 1.2e-40. “Shared protein domains” is an important part of the network. What would be the GeneMANIA results if we don’t include this source when we run GSEA? Go back to the ‘Network’ tab on the right side of the Cytoscape window to fin d the GeneMania search bar. Click on the option menu button which is located at the right of the search box. Uncheck ‘Shared protein domains’ and click on a point outside the box to close it. Click on the search icon . Explore the results. Answer If “shared protein domain” is removed, the relationships between the nodes are from the Co-expression, Co-localization, Predicted and Physical interactions networks. The genes added to the network are different compared to the first network created with “Shared protein domain”. Locate the Functions summary tab in Results Panel and look at what functions were significantly enriched with these new settings. Answer With the new settings, “hormone biosynthetic process” is the new top enriched pathway. Try to modify additional parameters like Max Resultant Genes or Network Weighting and look at how the changes you made influenced the results. EXERCISE 3: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW To start this exercise, you need to download the Mixed_gene_list.txt file and save it on your computer. For this exercise, you are working on a gene list created by combining 3 user defined gene lists available from the cBioportal (http://www.cbioportal.org). It contains genes implicated in the DNA damage response, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and Folate transport. This list is representative of a gene list obtained from transcriptomics data. During this exercise, we will first characterize our gene list based on functions and then we will add potential drug and microRNAs targeting genes in the network, and we will save the report. Skills: GeneMANIA search using a gene list; Navigating Search Results; Exploring Functions; Adding attributes; Create a report. STEPS Open Cytoscape and locate the GeneMANIA search window located on the left side in Control Panel. make sure that GeneMANIA is selected and not String. In the search window, ensure that the model organism is set to Homo sapiens . Copy and paste genes in the file Mixed_gene_list.txt. Click on the search icon and wait for the results. Explore the network. Locate the Functions summary tab in Result Panel and look at functions returned by GeneMANIA. In the functions summary tab, check some functions to color genes included in these functions. To follow this tutorial, you can for example color the “response to insulin” , “DNA recombination” functions. You need to scroll down to found DNA recombination as this pathway has an FDR greater than the one for “response to insulin”. To color genes: Go to Control Panel tabs located on the right side of the Cytoscape window and select the Style tab. * In the Node panel, expand the Fill Color tab. * Set Column to annotation name. * Locate “DNA recombination”. * Double click on the white space at the right side of the box and click on the 3 dots . A Colors box appears. * Choose a color of your choice and click on OK. * Locate “response to insulin”. Double click on the white space at the right side of the box and click on the 3 buttons menu. A Colors box appears. * Choose a color of your choice and click on OK. Locate our favorite gene PDPK1 on the network. Click on the icon First Neighbor of Selected Nodes . It will highlight this gene and all its connections. Click on the icon From Selected Nodes, all Edges to create a subnetwork. copy “PDPK1” in the search box and the node will be highlighted in yellow. SOME DEFINITIONS: What are the networks: Definition of the types of interaction: Shared domains: Protein domain data. Two gene products are linked if they have the same protein domain. These data are collected from domain databases, such as InterPro, SMART and Pfam. Co-localization: Genes expressed in the same tissue, or proteins found in the same location. Two genes are linked if they are both expressed in the same tissue or if their gene products are both identified in the same cellular location. Co-expression: Gene expression data. Two genes are linked if their expression levels are similar across conditions in a gene expression study. Most of these data are collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO); we only collect data associated with a publication. Predicted: Predicted functional relationships between genes, often protein interactions. A major source of predicted data is mapping known functional relationships from another organism via orthology. What is defined by evidence sources?: Evidence sources are the information contained in the multiple databases that GeneMANIA uses to establish interaction between two genes. Network: Node : circle representing the genes Edge: line that links two nodes and represent an interaction between two genes (multiple lines correspond to multiple sources Node size: Mapped to gene score, i.e. the degree to which GeneMANIA predicts the genes are related Thickness of edge: Strength/weight of interaction Layout : The layout is different each time so the user can request the layout run multiple times until the user is satisfied with the result. in Networks tab: Percent weight (score) : a higher weight means that this network helped more to find related genes. in Functions tab : FDR : False discovery rate (FDR) is greater than or equal to the probability that this is a false positive. Coverage : (number of genes in the network with a given function) / (all genes in the genome with the function) In advanced options: Network weighting? GeneMANIA can use a few different methods to weight networks when combining all networks to form the final composite network that results from a search. The default settings are usually appropriate, but you can choose a weighting method in the advanced option panel. (more details at http://pages.genemania.org/help/). Related genes : are genes added by GeneMANIA in addition to the genes from the query. It helps to grow the network and then to predict function of the query gene(s). The attributes represent the differences sources of evidence that can be used to build the network.

Explore and understand the main output features of GeneMANIA such as the network composition or the enriched functions. This practical consists of 3 exercises. You can choose to do these exercises using the questions as your only guide (section ‘QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW) - or see the following pages for the step-by-step checklist to finding the answers (section ’ANSWERS: DETAILED STEPS AND SCREENSHOTS’). Before starting the exercises,download the files: Right click on link below and select “Save Link As…”. Place the file in your CBW work directory in the corresponding module directory. 30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt Mixed_gene_list.txt CYP11B_pearson_correlation_prostate.txt Optional exercise: try to redo these exercises using the Cytoscape GeneMANIA application. Network layouts are flexible and can be rearranged. What you see when you perform these exercises may not be identical to what you see in the tutorial, or what you have seen other times that you have performed the exercises. Exact layouts and predictions can also be affected by updates to the networks database that GeneMANIA uses. However it is expected that the network weights and predicted genes will be similar to those shown here. EXERCISE 1: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW Imagine that you are interested in exploring the function of the human GRN gene: GRN returned as the strongest hit from your omics experiment but not many information about this gene is available in functional databases. Use GeneMANIA to identify its predicted function as well as potential interaction partners. Skills: GeneMANIA Single Gene search; Navigating Search Results; Exploring available Genes features; Rerun a new analysis using a single gene or multiple genes query from the network. STEPS Go to GeneMANIA’s homepage at http://www.genemania.org/ In the search window, ensure that the model organism is set to Homo sapiens . Enter the following gene: GRN Click on the search icon and wait for the results. When your search results load, examine the network. Genes you searched with are indicated with stripes, related genes added by GeneMANIA are represented in black, and colored links represent the interactions that connect the nodes (genes). Tip: zoom in and zoom out using trackpad or mouse scrolling up and down using the mouse or trackpad or zoom in to the maximum using the specific icon . Clicking on a node gives information about the name of gene, the possibility to add, remove this gene or search with this gene only. Click on the GRN node and explore the displayed information. Locate the Functions summary tab (bottom left icon ). What are the functions significantly associated with this network? GRN is the central node of this network: which function would you predict for GRN? How well did GeneMANIA perform (hints: use GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/) , PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/))? Locate the gene with the strongest association with GRN. Tip: this gene is the largest node on the network. Re-run an analysis by adding SORT1, HSPG2 to the search. Click on SORT1, click on Add or type the name of the gene in the search box. Do the same for HSPG2. The genes are now added to the search box and a new network is automatically created. Which functions are associated with this new network ? On the left side of the window are located icons that we haven’t yet explored. The first 3 buttons are activating different network layouts. Try the circular , the aligned , and the force_directed layouts. Choose your favorite layout and save the network as an image using the Network image As Shown option from the save menu . EXERCISE 1 ANSWERS: DETAILED EXPLANATION AND SCREENSHOTS EXERCISE 1 - STEPS 1-4 GM1 EXERCISE 1 - STEP 5 GM2 EXERCISE 1 - STEP 6 GM3 Exercise 1 - STEP 7 GM4 Question What are the functions significantly associated with this network? Answer the list of the functions associated with the network are listed in the above screenshot. “lysosomal function”, “vacuolar lumen”, “vacuolar part” are significant under a FDR threshold less than 0.0001. Question GRN is the central node of this network: which function would you predict for GRN? Answer : a function related to lysosome and vacuole Question How well did GeneMANIA perform (hints: use GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/) , PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/))? Answer The top functions predicted by GeneMANIA for GRN were related to lysosome and vacuole. A pubmed search could confirm these results: “We experimentally verified that granulin precursor (GRN) gene, whose mutations cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is involved in lysosome function.” (Transcriptional gene network inference from a massive dataset elucidates transcriptome organization and gene function. Belcastro et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Nov 1;39(20):8677-88. 2011. PMID:21785136) Exercise 1 - STEP 8 Question Locate the gene with the strongest association with GRN (thick edge). Answer is SORT1 Exercise 1 - STEP 9 GM5 GM6 Exercise 1 - STEP 10 (layouts) Circular layout GM7 Aligned layout GM8 Force directed layout GM9 Exercise 1 - STEP 11 (save an image) GM10 Notes about biological interpretation of the results: A paper describing the interaction between GRN and SORT1 and demonstrates how finding related genes could be relevant for elaborating therapy: Targeted manipulation of the sortilin–progranulin axis rescues progranulin haploinsufficiency. Lee et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2014 March 15; 23(6): 1467–1478. Published online 2013 October 26. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddt534. PMCID:PMC3929086 “Progranulin (GRN) mutations causing haploinsufficiency are a major cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). Recent discoveries demonstrating sortilin (SORT1) is a neuronal receptor for PGRN endocytosis and a determinant of plasma PGRN levels portend the development of enhancers targeting the SORT1–PGRN axis. We demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of several approaches through which impairing PGRN’s interaction with SORT1 restores extracellular PGRN levels. “ GM11 EXERCISE 2: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW To start this exercise, you need to download the 30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt file from the course wiki and save it on your computer. For this exercise, you are working with a list of 30 prostate cancer genes. This list can be downloaded after the workshop from the cBioPortal website (http://www.cbioportal.org/) under the download section, user defined list. The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics stores genomic data from large scale, integrated cancer genomic data sets. During this exercise, you will explore the types of networks that have been used to create the GeneMANIA network from the prostate cancer gene list and you will see how changing input parameters can affect the results. The last step of the exercise consists of uploading a custom network which is a list of genes that are positively correlated with CYP11B1 in mRNA expression data of 94 prostate cancer samples (http://www.cbioportal.org/) . Skills: GeneMANIA search using a gene list; Navigating Search Results; Exploring Networks and advanced options; Uploading a custom network. STEPS Go to GeneMANIA’s homepage at http://www.genemania.org/ In the search window, ensure that the model organism is set to Homo sapiens . Copy and paste genes in the file 30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt. Make sure that the parameter ‘Max resultant genes’ is set to ‘20’ by clicking on the 3 menu buttons at the right side of the search box and selecting ‘Customise advanced options’. Click on the search icon and wait for the results. When your search results load, examine the network. Genes you searched with are indicated with stripes, related genes added by GeneMANIA are represented in black, and colored links represent the interactions that connect the nodes (genes). Move nodes around by selecting them with a mouse to investigate how they are connected. Click any link (edge) connecting two nodes to highlight information about it. Clicking on an edge between 2 nodes will display information about all interaction networks that connect these 2 nodes. It indicates the reference (publication) for these interactions. The colors indicate the type of interaction (co-expression, shared protein domains, co-localization, physical interactions and predicted). Locate and expand the ‘Networks’ summary tab (on the right ) and look at what data has been used to create the network and predictions. that Co-expression (purple colored lines, weight over 30%) and Shared protein domains (lightgold colored lines, weight over 30%) influence the results the most, but Co-localization (blue colored lines), Physical interactions (salmon colored lines) and Predicted (orange) data are also included. At the top of the Networks summary tab, try Expand “none”, then “top” and “all” to get information about the sources of the different networks. Highlight all connections corresponding to each network by clicking the name of each network category. Click on “Shared protein domains” and see which genes are connected by predicted protein protein interaction. You can do the same for “Co-localization” , “Co-expression” and “Physical interactions”. Tips: these observations of the number of connections make it easier to understand why co-expression and shared protein domains get the higher percent weight on this network: they are helping to connect more genes than physical interactions and predicted; A higher weight means that this network helped more to find related genes. Locate the Functions summary tab (bottom left ) and look at what functions were significantly enriched in this list of prostate genes. “Shared protein domains” is an important part of the network.

What would be the GeneMANIA results if we don’t include this source when we run GSEA? Answer If “shared protein domain” is removed, the relationships between the nodes are from the Co-expression, Co-localization, Predicted and Physical interactions networks.The genes added to the network are different compared to the first network created with “Shared protein domain”. GM20 GM21 Exercise 2 - STEP 11 Question what functions were significantly enriched with these new settings. Answer With the new settings, “hormone biosynthetic process” is the new top enriched pathway. GM22 Exercise 2 - STEP 12 GM23 GM24 GM25 Exercise 2 - STEP 13. GM26 How to get the 30 prostate cancer gene list: GM27 EXERCISE 3: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW To start this exercise, you need to download the Mixed_gene_list.txt file and save it on your computer. For this exercise, you are working on a gene list created by combining 3 user defined gene lists available from the cBioportal (http://www.cbioportal.org). It contains genes implicated in the DNA damage response, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and Folate transport. This list is representative of a gene list obtained from transcriptomics data. During this exercise, we will first characterize our gene list based on functions and then we will add potential drug and microRNAs targeting genes in the network, and we will save the report. Skills: GeneMANIA search using a gene list; Navigating Search Results; Exploring Functions; Adding attributes; Create a report. STEPS Go to GeneMANIA’s homepage at http://www.genemania.org/. In the search window, ensure that the model organism is set to Homo sapiens . Copy and paste genes in the file Mixed_gene_list.txt. Click on the search icon and wait for the results. Locate the Functions summary tab (bottom left ) and look at functions returned by GeneMANIA In the functions summary tab, check some functions to color genes included in these functions. To follow this tutorial, you can for example color the “response to insulin” , “DNA recombination” and“vitamin transport” functions. Tip: You need to scroll down to found DNA recombination and vitamin transport as these pathways have an FDR greater than the one for “response to insulin”. We are going next to add miRs and drug interaction networks. Click on ‘Show advanced option ’ which is located at the right of the search box. In the ‘Networks’ tab, expand ‘Attributes’ and check “Drug-interactions-2013” and “miRNA-target-predictions-2013”. Check “Physical interactions” and “Co-expression” .

Final slides Lecture Goal Familiarize yourself with g:Profiler, GSEA , EnrichmentMap using the Esophageal adenocarcinoma gene expression data (DATASET 1). Familiarize yourself with ReactomeFI and GeneMANIA using mutation data (DATASET 2). Network layouts are flexible and can be rearranged. What you see when you perform these exercises may not be identical to what you see in the tutorial, or what you have seen other times that you have performed the exercises. Exact layouts and predictions can also be affected by updates to the networks database that the tools are using. However it is expected that the network weights and predicted genes will be similar to those shown here. DATASET 1 Background Gene expression data from Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is used for this first part of the integrated assignment. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has a rising incidence and a 5-year survival of only 15%. The single major risk factor for development of EAC is chronic heartburn, which eventually leads to a change in the lining of the esophagus called Barrett’s Esophagus (BE). Specimens were collected from patients with normal esophagus (NE) and Barrett’s esophagus (BE). RNA was extracted from these samples and expression profiling was assessed using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarray PMID:24714516. Differentially expressed genes between BE and NE were determined. Data processing The Affymetrix data are stored in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under the accession number GSE39491 PMID:24714516. The RMA (Robust Multichip Average) normalized data were downloaded from GEO and further processed using the Bioconductor package limma to estimate differential expression between the groups. The results of the limma t-tests were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-HochBerg method (FDR). For g:Profiler, genes with a FDR equal or less than 0.0001 and a logFC of 2 were retrieved and stored in a text file. For GSEA, a rank file has been created by ranking the genes from the highest t statistics value (up-regulated in BE compared to NE) to the lowest t values (down-regulated in BE compared to NE). The code used to process the data is available from this link. Please feel free to adapt it and use it with your own data. PART 1: run g:Profiler Open g:Profiler In Options, make sure All results is not checked (this keeps significant results only) In Advanced option, Set Benjamini-Hochberg in the ‘Significance threshold’ box. In Data sources , select GO molecular function, No electronic GO annotations, and Reactome. Run analysis of the genes differentially altered between BE and normal: copy and paste the gene list into the g:Profiler input window BEonly_genelist.txt. Question: What is the most significant GO:term? What is the p-value for this GO:term? Question: Is this p-value already corrected for multiple hypothesis testing? What type of correction is used for your current analysis? PART 2: save as Generic Enrichment Map output (BE) Now we have to generate an output from the enrichment analysis and save it in appropriate format for EnrichmentMap. Set the maximum term size to 1000. Scroll down, select the tab for Detailed results, and export the data in Generic EnrichmentMap (GEM) format and save it on your computer. We will need this file to create an enrichment map. PART 3: save as Generic Enrichment Map output (NE) Generate and save the Generic EnrichmentMap for genes in NConly_genelist.txt (i.e., delete the old gene list and copy/paste the new gene list in the box). It contains the genes specific of the normal tissue samples. Run g:Profiler with this list using same options as in PART 1 and again save the output as a Generic Enrichment Map (GEM) format. We will need this file for EnrichmentMap. PART 4: create an enrichment map Create an enrichment map to visualize the outputs from g:Profiler. Let’s create an EnrichmentMap for the pathways that were enriched by the genes specific of the BE samples and one for the genes specific of the NE samples. Make sure to rename your g:Profiler results so you know which one is BE and which one is NE. Open Cytoscape Go: Apps and click on EnrichmentMap. A ‘Create Enrichment Map’ dialog box appears. Drag and Drop the 2 g:Profiler result files in the ‘Data Sets:’ window. It populated automatically two data sets on for the BE results and one for the NE results. Make sure that for the 2 datasets the ‘Analysis Type’ is set to ‘Generic/gProfiler/enrichr’ and that the g:Profiler result file has been correctly uploaded in the ‘Enrichments’ field. As ‘Network Name’, uncheck ‘Use Default’ and write “BEvsNE” or the name of your choice for this network. Set the ‘FDR q-value cutoff’ to 0.05. ‘Build’ the map. If successful, you will see a network where each node represents a pathway and edges connect pathways with shared genes. Blue edges connect nodes from dataset1 (BE in my case) and Green edges connect nodes from dataset2 (NE in my case). In Control Panel and in the ‘EnrichmentMap’ tab, go to ‘Style’ (near the bottom) and change the ‘Chart Data:’ to ‘Color by Data Set’. Now the nodes are colored in blue for dataset1 and in green for dataset2. Annotate the network using the AutoAnnotate Apps. Try different layouts if you’d like. Zoom in and move nodes around to be able to read the labels. Select a node of your choice. When the node is highlighted, the ‘EM Heat Map’ in ‘Table Panel’ will display the genes in this pathway that are overlapping with your input gene list. A gray square means that the gene is absent in the dataset. Note: you also could create and upload an expression file when you build the enrichment map, and the expression values for each gene in the pathways will be displayed here in the ‘EM Heat Map’. Click on any edge (the line between nodes). In the ‘Table panel’ (‘EM Heat Map’) you should see a heatmap of all genes both gene-sets connected by this edge have in common. Select several nodes and edges. EM Heat map will show the union of all genes (Genes: All) or genes in common (Genes:Common) in the selected gene sets. In Control Panel, go to the EnrichmentMap tab. Change Q-value as well as Edge (Similarity) cutoffs and see how the network changes. Redo the layout. Save the file. Question What conclusions can you make based on these networks? Answers g:Profiler Question: What is the most significant GO:term? What is the p-value for this GO:term Answer: extracellular matrix/structure organization Question: Is this p-value already corrected for multiple testing? What type of correction is used for your current analysis? Answer: yes, it is already corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. I set the Significance threshold box to “Benjaminin-Hochberg FDR”. Re-run the analysis with User p-value threshold set to 0.0001. Question: What has been changed? Answer: Only the gene-set with adjusted pvalue equal or less than 0.0001 are displayed. The list is reduced compared to the results obtained with the default settings. Ordered query: Question: Do you seen any changes in the output in comparison to the analysis of the unordered gene list (PART 2) Answer Although some terms are similar, their pvalues changed as well as the number of term genes used to calculate the pvalue. Question What can you conclude about these networks? Answer The pathways are relevant to the biological model under study. The changes are related to the transformation of the epithelial cells into mesenchymal ones. PART 5: GSEA (run and create an enrichment map) Launch GSEA. Run GSEA using the rank file that has been created from the differential expression test comparing BE vs NE BEvsNE_ranks.rnk and the pathway file Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_July_01_2020_symbol.gmt. open GSEA and first import the files using the “Load data” window: upload the .rnk and .gmt files (the gmt file can be found by clicking the three dots next to ‘Gene sets database’ and clicking on ’Gene matrix (local gmx/gmt) ). Go the ‘Run GSEAPreranked’ window and select the correct gmt file and the rank file Use 100 permutations for the lab exercise. For time reasons - Use 100 permutations for the lab exercise but use 1000 for your own data analysis. Choose a name for your analysis, a destination folder and run GSEA. Create an enrichment map: Open Cytoscape and the EnrichmentMap app. The enrichment results are 2 excel files called gsea_report_for_na_neg and gsea_report_for_na_pos within the GSEA folder saved on your computer but you should be able to drag and drop the whole GSEA folder and that will populate the required fields automatically. use an FDR q-value cutoff of 0.01. Upload the expression file BE_vs_NE_expression.txt(right click, save link as). Examine the results as you did for the g:Profiler map (e.g move nodes around, use the slide bar to adjust q value to 0.01 and redo the layout, separate blue and red nodes). Save the file. Save an image. Keep your session open for Part 8. Optional: Autoannotate your map (see below screenshot for results) Note: you may get slightly different results as 100 permutations is not enough to get reliable results. It is better to use 1000 permuatations. Answers GSEA PART 6: iRegulon Export extracellular matrix genes. Using your GSEA map at q-value 0.01, select all nodes from the extracellular matrix organization node. Go to Table Panel (below the main window), and click on the menu icon (located on the right, 3 lines) and click on ‘Export as TXT’ (all genes). Save the text file under the name ‘extracellularmatrix_cluster_genes.txt’ or use this file extracellular_matrix_organization.txt. Import the extracellular matrix genes as a network. In Cytoscape, go to the menu bar and select, File, Import, Network from File… Browse your computer and select the ‘extracellular_matrix_organization.txt’ file and click on open. An ‘Import Network From Table’ window opens and in the table preview, make sure that the ‘Gene’ column is the source node (green dot). Click on ‘OK’. A ‘Confirmation’ dialog box saying that ‘No edges will be created in the network’ opens. Click on ‘Yes’. Select nodes and run iRegulon. If successful, you should see a grid of gray nodes. If you are zoomed out, they might be very faint. Zoom in until you see them, then zoom out until you see all the nodes and select them all using the mouse. Go the Cytoscape menu and select ‘Apps’, ‘iRegulon’, ‘Predict regulators and targets’. Click on ‘Submit’. Observe the iRegulon results in the Results Panel. Add TCF12 and BATF to the network. Go to the \"Transcription Factors’ tab and click on the first hit (TCF12) to select it. Add it to the network using the green ‘+’ button . Execute the same steps for the second hit (BATF). If successful, you should see targets of TCF12 and BATF linked to these 2 genes by edges (lines). Create a subnetwork with all nodes connected to TCF12 and BATF. using the mouse select TCF12 and all edges around this node and pressing the shift key, select also BATF and all the edges around this node. All selected edges should now be highlighted in red and the 2 transcription factors in yellow. In the Cytoscape menu bar, go to Select, Nodes, Nodes connected by selected edges. More nodes should be selected now and the edges still highlighted in red. Select the subnetwork icon (‘New Network from Selection (all edges)’)from the Cytoscape toolbar. If successful, you should have created a subnetwork containing only the targeted genes and the two transcription factors. Arrange the network such that we can distinguish genes linked to TCF12 only , linked to BATF only or linked to both transcription factors. go to the Cytoscape menu, Layout, Circular Layout, all Nodes. Feel free to use your own strategy. Optional. Import the .rnk file that we use for GSEA BEvsNE_ranks.rnk as attribute and color the nodes accordingly to the score values. in the menu bar, select, File, Import, Table from File…, select the rank file and click on ‘Open’. A dialog box (‘Import Columns From Table’) opens. Click on ‘Advanced options’ and uncheck ‘Use first line as column names’ and click ‘OK’. Rename Column2 as ‘myscore’. Click ‘OK’. in Control Panel, go to Style and in the Node tab, expand the ‘Fill Color’ tab. Retrieve and select the ‘myscore’ column in the ‘column’ fied. Make sure that the ‘Mapping type’ is set to ‘Continuous Mapping’. The score should ranged from -13.16 to 13.16. Adjust the color if necessary. Screenshot of resulting network: DATASET 2 Stomach cancer or gastric cancer is a cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. The most common cause is infection by the bacteria Helicopter pylori, which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of ‘H. pylori’ have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. MutSig - is a mutation signal processing tool created by the Broad Institute. It estimates the significance of the gene mutation rate based on abundances of the mutations, clustering of the mutations in hotspots and conservation of the mutated positions. The gene list for this assignment is the output from MutSig run based on Stomach Adenocarcinoma somatic mutations found in ~300 samples. It is publicly available through TCGA portal. File provided: STAD_MutSig.txt Goal: familiarize yourself with ReactomeFI and GeneMANIA. PART 1: ReactomeFI Create a network using ReactomeFI. Open Cytoscape. Choose App -&gt; Reactome FI -&gt; Gene set/mutation analysis Upload STAD_MutSig.txt and built a network without linkers: The network may look slightly different compared to below screenshot if the underlying database has been updated since the screenshot was taken upload your file or copy and paste the gene names in the gene set field. Fetch FI annotation (Hint: right click on a blank space, Reactome FI, Fetch FI Annotations). You should see arrows (directed graph). Run Pathway enrichment (Hint: right click on the network panel and select Reactome FI &gt; Analyze network functions &gt; Pathway enrichment). Question What is the pathway with the lowest (best) FDR? Do a subnetwork of Endometrial cancer (K). select the pathway in the table, that should highlight the genes in yellow. Use the subnetwork icon on the Cytoscape tool bar to create it (“New network from selection”). Go back to the full network (in the Control panel on the left, click the highest level of ‘STAD_MutSig’). Cluster the network and perform pathway enrichment on the network. Questions How many clusters did the analysis retrieve? What is the FDR value of the most significant pathway of module 0 Answers REACTOME FI Pathway enrichment on the whole network. Question What is the pathway with the lowest (best) FDR? Answer The pathway with the lowest FDR is Endometrial cancer (K) . Cluster the network and perform pathway enrichment on the network. Question How many clusters did the analysis retrieve? Answer The analysis retrieved 9 clusters named module 0 to module 8. Question What is the FDR value of the most significant pathway of module 0? Answer FLT3 signaling (first row) PART 2: GeneMANIA Use the same mutation data STAD_MutSig.txt to create a network using GeneMANIA in order to visualize which genes are known to physically interact with each other. Create the network In Cytoscape, go to Control Panel and locate and select the Network Tab in the Control Panel Make sure the GeneMANIA search provider is selected in the Network Search Bar. Choose Homo sapiens from the list of supported organisms Copy and paste the gene list STAD_MutSig.txt in the field. Locate the “More Options…” button at the right side of the field and only select ‘Physical interactions’ as ‘Interaction Networks’ and set 0 to the ‘Max Resultant Genes’. Click the “Search Network” button The network may look slightly different compared to below screenshot if the underlying database has been updated since the screenshot was taken. Screenshot of the output: the screenshot only includes nodes connected to other nodes. Singletons are not part of the screenshot. Explore the functions in the GeneMANIA Results Panel. Go to ‘Results Panel’ located at the right side and select the GeneMANIA tab. Choose the ‘Functions’ tab to visualize the list of enriched GO gene-sets. Question Can you see which genes are included in these gene-sets? Hint: you can click on a function of your choice to see corresponding nodes highlighted in yellow. Improve the visual style: Color nodes by function. In Control Panel, select the ‘Style’ tab and go to the ‘Node’ panel. Expand the ‘Fill Color’ field using the down arrow and set ‘Column’ to ‘annotation name’ which is the top field (/! not ‘annotations’). Select one annotation of your choice by clicking on the white space and choose a color. Repeat for 2 more annotation names. For the current example, we have selected the top 3 enriched GO annotations ‘gamma-catenin binding’, ‘regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity’ and ‘adherens junction organization’. Hint: the annotation names are displayed in alphabetical order. Edge width (optional). In Control Panel, go to the ‘Edge’ panel. Expand the ‘Width’ field using the down arrow. A grah is displayed. Double click on the graph to select it and move the left and right handles up. Look at the changes on the network (suggested values are approximately 7 for the left handle and approximately 18 for the right handle). Click on OK. Create a subnetwork containing CTNNB1 and connected genes Locate CTNNB1, use the “First neighbors of selected nodes” icon (has the shape of 2 houses) in the toolbar to highlight genes connected to CTNNB1 Create a subnetwork using the approriate icon. How many nodes do contain this subnetwork? Hint: Go to Control Panel, Network and look at the number of nodes corresponding to your subnetwork. Note: on the above the screenshot, the CCBN1 color of the edges were changed by bypassing the style (select the edges, right click, edit, ByPass Style, Set Bypass to Selected Edges , change color in Byp. column) Optional part 2: Use STRING from the Network Search Bar STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) is a biological database and web resource of known and predicted protein–protein interactions. In Cytoscape, go to Control Panel and locate and select the Network Tab in the Control Panel Make sure ‘STRING protein query’ is selected in the Network Search Bar. Type CTNNB1 in the search field.
